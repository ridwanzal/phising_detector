<font face="Arial">John 1:1 In the <b><i>beginning</i> (eternal past)</b>
was the <b>Word</b> (lima = revelation), and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.</font>

<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>(no angels, no heaven, no earth,
no planets, no moon, no sun, no galaxy, no universe, no time, no space,
nothing, <u>only</u> God, The Word, [the express image or <b>revelation</b>
of God] and The Spirit of God; Just God)</font></font></i>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Nine Revelations of Jesus as the Word:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial">1. The preexisting Word.</font></b>

<br>John 1:2 The same was in the beginning <u>with</u> God.&nbsp;
<p><b>2. The personal Word.</b>
<br><b>John 1:3 All things were made <font face="Arial"><i><font size=+1>by
him</font></i></font></b><font face="Arial">; and without him was not any
thing made that was made.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">3. The creative Word.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">(He is also the doer of all that God wants to do
<b><i><font size=+1>by
him</font></i></b>.)</font>

<p><b><font face="Arial">4. The life-giving Word.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light
of men.</font>
<br><i><font face="Arial">(Anyone that receives LIFE from him also receives
LIGHT (revelation) <u>of</u> him. Anyone that COMES to him, he will reveal
himself to them.) (The key here is to COME, [<b><u>fellowship</u></b>],
not just showing up.)</font></i>
<p><b><font face="Arial">5. The light-giving Word.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness; and
the darkness comprehended it not.</font><font face="Arial"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">6. The illuminating Word.</font></b>

<br><font face="Arial">John 1:9 That was the true Light, which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.</font><font face="Arial"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">7. The saving Word.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave
he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</font><b><font face="Arial"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial">8. The incarnate Word.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us, (and we beheld his glory <i>(he is the totality of God?s Glory),</i>
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and <b><i><u><font size=+1>truth</font></u></i></b>.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">(You can?t have truth without grace, you can?t
have grace without truth.)</font></i><b><font face="Arial"></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial">9. The gracious Word.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 1:16 And of his fullness have all we received,
and grace for grace.</font><b><font face="Arial"></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">We receive truth when we COME in continuous fellowship
[dining, supping, and staying] by <i>living it</i>. <i>(We are talking
about prayer here!) </i>When you live it, you have liberty!</font>
<p><font face="Arial">John 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed
on him, <b><i><u>If ye continue in my Word</u></i></b>, then are ye my
<b><i><u>disciples</u></i></b>
indeed;</font>

<p><font face="Arial">John 8:32 And <b><i><u>ye shall know the truth</u></i>
(Who will reveal the truth? Jesus!), (what will the truth give you? Freedom!)</b>,
and <b><i><u>the truth shall make you free</u></i></b>.</font></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial">Here are 7 results of COMING to him.</font></b>
<dir><b><font face="Arial">1. Prayer is answered instantly.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 15:7 <b><i><u>If ye abide in me</u></i></b>,
<i>(if
you come and the fellowship continues),</i> and <i>(then)</i> <b><i><u>my
Words abide in you</u></i></b>, <b><i><u>ye shall ask what ye will, and
it shall be done unto you</u></i></b>.</font>

<p><b><font face="Arial">2. You will bear fruit for him.</font></b>
<br><i><font face="Arial">(If you read the Bible but do not fellowship
with God in prayer, the Bible will have NO EFFECT on your life!)</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">John 15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that <b><i><u>ye
bear much fruit</u></i></b>; so shall ye be my disciples.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">3. You will continue in his love.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 15:9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I
loved you<b><i><u>: continue ye in my love</u></i></b>.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">4. You will remain joyful.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 15:11 These things have I spoken unto you,
that

<b><i><u>my joy might remain in you</u></i></b>, and that your joy
might be full.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">5. It is now possible to love others as God loves
you.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 15:12 This is my commandment, That <b><i><u>ye
love one another, as I have loved you</u></i></b>.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">6. Fullness of revelation.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial">John 15:15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for
the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends;
<b><i><u>for
all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you</u></i></b>.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">7. Our fruit will remain permanently.</font></b>

<br><font face="Arial">John 15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <b><i><u>that
your fruit should remain</u></i></b>: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
Father in my name, he may give it you.</font>
