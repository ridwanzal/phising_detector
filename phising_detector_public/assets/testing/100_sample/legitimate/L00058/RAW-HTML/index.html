Here&#8217;s a Q&amp;A in plain English about what you need to know about the case, including each side&#8217;s strategy and possible outcomes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are Google and Oracle in court?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The case is about intellectual property. It began six years ago when Oracle sued Google for using APIs tied to Java (more on this below) without permission. Google won at an initial trial in 2012 when a jury found the company didn&#8217;t infringe Oracle&#8217;s patents, and a judge concluded the APIs didn&#8217;t qualify for copyright protection.<\/p>\n<p>But in a ruling that shocked the tech community, an appeals court found in 2014 that Oracle&#8217;s APIs were indeed covered by copyright. The ruling also kicked the case back to the lower court to determine whether Google&#8217;s use of the APIs counted as a &#8220;fair use.&#8221; Now, at this second trial, a jury will look at the fair use question.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does &#8220;fair use&#8221; come into it? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fair use is a part of copyright law that allows use of a work without the author&#8217;s permission. Examples are parody sketches that use famous TV or movie characters, or a book review that quotes a section of a a novel. The Oracle-Google trial is unusual because you normally see fair use debates in the realm of media and the arts, not computer science.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the legal standard is the same. It consists of a <a href=\"http:\/\/fairuse.stanford.edu\/overview\/fair-use\/four-factors\/\">four-part test<\/a> that weighs: 1) the purpose of the use (i.e. Why did you use it?); 2) the nature of the work (i.e. How much creativity was involved?) 3) the amount used (How much did you take?); 4) the effect on the market for the work.<\/p>\n<p>While courts weigh all the factors, many legal scholars think numbers one (purpose) and four (effect on market) are the only ones that really matter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the case so important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s partly about the money. Oracle wants a jury to order Google, which is now part of the holding company Alphabet, to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/28\/oracle-google-legal-billions\/\">pay $9.3 <em>billion<\/em> <\/a>in damages. That figure is more than half of Google&#8217;s overall profits from 2015. But it&#8217;s unlikely Oracle, if it wins, will get even close to that amount.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger issue, instead, is the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/02\/24\/google-renews-push-for-fair-use-of-apis-before-oracle-trial\/\">fair use one<\/a>. If the jury sides finds Google&#8217;s activities were not fair use, it could be open season on other software companies, big and small, that rely on unlicensed APIs.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, developers have long treated APIs as a standard set of instructions outside the realm of copyright. Now, if Google loses, they could have to seek a license or basically reinvent the wheel every time they want one computer program to interact with another. As prominent computer scientists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/files\/filenode\/2013.1021.1022.computer.scientists.amici_.brief_.pdf\">told the appeals court<\/a>, allowing companies to assert copyright over APIs could have a profound and negative effect on software innovation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are these APIs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An API, which is short for Application Programming Interface, is a set of instructions that allow one type of software talk to another. For instance, you might have seen Google Maps built into a third party app or a &#8220;tweet this&#8221; button on a web page \u2014 this only works because Google and Twitter provided an API to make the app and website work with their software. (Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.pearson.com\/blog\/whats-api-3-ways-explain-it\">non-technical <\/a>explanation).<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Oracle, it controls libraries of APIs tied to the popular programming language Java. When Google began adding Java features to its Android software in 2007, it replicated portions of those APIs because developers were already familiar with them. Those portions related to headers and sequences\u2014they act kind of like a table of contents that shows what goes where.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will Google argue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google will tell the jury that its use of the APIs was transformative under the first part of the four-part test. Specifically, it will argue that its use of the Java APIs for a mobile operating system was a new and original purpose outside. The company will also argue that APIs rank low on the creativity scale and that it will used a very amount of the overall code controlled by Oracle\u2014thus, the second and third parts of the test favor Google. Finally, it will say the market harm part of the test favors Google because no one was using the APIs for mobile devices in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Google will also try to frame this as a story of greed on the part of Oracle, accusing its rival of trying to do through litigation what it can&#8217;t do through innovation. It will cast itself as the champion of the tech community and software developers, who will suffer if Oracle can copyright APIs.<\/p>\n<p>As a fall back plan, Google is also relying on other defenses besides fair use. Specifically, this will involve asking U.S. District Judge William Alsup to find Oracle can&#8217;t sue in the first place because it waited too long and because it once implied to Google that it wouldn&#8217;t sue (legal arguments known as laches and estoppel).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will Oracle argue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, Oracle will put a very different gloss on the four fair use factors. It will tell the jury Google did nothing transformative with the APIs but simply lifted them to make money. It will claim the APIs represent a lot of skill and creativity, and that Google used thousands of lines of its code without permission, which is no small amount. Finally, it will say the success of Android shows clear harm in the market\u2014i.e. that Oracle would have been able to collect millions in licensing fees but didn&#8217;t since Google simply took the APIs.<\/p>\n<p>Oracle will also rebut Google&#8217;s story of innovation by painting its rival as a lawless company that just took what it wanted rather than play by the rules. It will argue that Google&#8217;s claims of principles are just a smokescreen to cover up the fact that it was in a rush to build its Android system and took a shortcut by stealing Oracle&#8217;s code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will the jury decide?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Juries are often swayed by stories and emotions more than by dry legal arguments. This means that the outcome may turn less on a sober analysis of the fair use factors and instead on how they feel about each company. Is Google defending innovation against Oracle&#8217;s greed? Or did Google just disregard the rules for the sake of its own self-interest?<\/p>\n<p>The judge, who found for Google the first time around, will have a role to play, too, through his instructions and how he steers the trial. He could also sidestep the jury&#8217;s fair use finding by deciding the case on one of the other defenses (laches or estoppel) described above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long will this take?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The jury selection starts on Monday, and the case is expected to last weeks. The first portion of the trial will focus on the fair use arguments. If the jury sides with Oracle, the trial will then move to a damages phase to see how much Google should pay. At this point, Google would also set out its other defenses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will there be another appeal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty good bet. If Google loses, it will have to appeal once again to the Federal Circuit of Appeals, whose job is ordinarily to oversee patent claims\u2014and which many blame for botching the original ruling. This would likely be a stepping stone to the Supreme Court, which refused to get involved the first time around over the question of whether APIs can be copyrighted in the first place.

His Way Forward After Employing a Serial Killer","content":"<p>Business leaders often speak about overcoming challenges, but few have encountered the crisis Dennis C. Miller faced in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>The headlines were everywhere: Charles Cullen, a nurse at Somerset Medical Center in New Jersey, had been charged with murdering one patient and attempting to kill another by administering lethal combinations of drugs. The so-called \u201cAngel of Death,\u201d who confessed to killing as many as 40 patients over the course of his 16-year nursing career, would eventually receive multiple consecutive life sentences.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of Cullen\u2019s employment at Somerset Medical, Miller was the hospital\u2019s chief executive. Months before Cullen\u2019s murderous activity was splashed across headlines, the hospital conducted its own internal investigation following two unexplained medical incidents in the ICU (one patient survived, the other died). But it failed to bring its suspicions to the police. As the story unfolded in public, Miller\u2019s decision not to report the hospital\u2019s concerns about Cullen to law enforcement was placed under increasing scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>Cullen may have been the central villain, but the press portrayed Miller as a silent accomplice. According to report in 60 Minutes, five patients died in the three-month window between the start of Somerset\u2019s internal investigation and Cullen\u2019s arrest.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, Miller says he was simply following the advice of the hospital\u2019s longstanding general counsel: \u201cI\u2019m not passing judgment whether good, bad or indifferent, but the whole thing almost from the get-go was organized by him, not me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Related: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/05\/venture-capital-health-care\/\" target=\"_blank\">Venture Capital Is Facing an Impending Health-Care &#8216;Avalanche&#8217;<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For an angry public, this was a technicality. After Cullen\u2019s arrest in December 2003, Miller did a series of high-profile interviews \u2013 with Katie Couric, Wolf Blitzer, and Morley Safer, among others \u2013 in an attempt to be forthcoming and set the record straight.<\/p>\n<p>Despite his attempt at transparency, Miller sensed he wouldn\u2019t survive the tragedy. After all, Cullen had worked for years, unchecked, under his leadership. \u201cI took this personally. I\u2019m hospital CEO,\u201d he says \u201cPeople died here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In one way he was right. About seven months after Cullen\u2019s arrest, the hospital asked for Miller\u2019s resignation. It was a tortured time. After losing his job, Miller spoke to a headhunter who told him that thanks to his association with Cullen, \u201cyou\u2019ll never get another job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Starting again.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite the tragedy\u2019s unfathomable scale &#8212; investigators would uncover that Cullen killed 13 patients while employed at Somerset Medical &#8212; Miller refused to crumble under its weight.<\/p>\n<p>Today, he coaches, consults, speaks and writes books on leadership and strategy in the nonprofit sector. He\u2019s worked with Franklin Pierce University and Princeton University, but he now mostly consults organizations that focus on behavioral wellness, such as NewBridge Services, New Jersey Association for Mental Health and Addiction Agencies and Montgomery Academy.<\/p>\n<p>When the hospital let him go, Miller\u2019s professional future was one giant question mark. He tentatively began networking, searching for a new path that would provide his days with some much needed structure. Shortly after his dismissal, he had an informal meeting with Robin Albers, the regional vice president for the American Cancer Society in North Jersey. She asked for his advice on how to raise money, build a healthy board and develop a brand within the community.<\/p>\n<p>Miller didn\u2019t know what the next chapter of his life would look like, but these were questions he could answer. In his car after the meeting, a light bulb suddenly went off &#8212; maybe this was his calling. Since 2005, he estimates he\u2019s coached \u201chundreds of nonprofit organizations,\u201d helping them do everything from become more engaged with their communities, build better boards and raise more money.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4570538677001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4570538677001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1T0McAw\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3D27years%2Cenglishpremierleague%2Cepl%2Csecretsofsuccess%2Csiralexferguson%2Csirmichaelmoritz%2Csoccercoach%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dsiralexferguson&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, Miller did a review for Make-A-Wish New Jersey. Thanks to his advice, which included refining the nonprofit\u2019s message, increasing the size of its board and identifying steps for succession planning, the organization is in a stronger position, says CEO Tom Weatherall. Another client, Xiomara Guevara, executive director of the Morris County Organization for Hispanic Affairs, cites Miller as a driving force behind a community center that helps residents navigate a path to citizenship. Without Dennis\u2019s mentorship, she says, \u201cwe would not have moved forward with the project.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a calling,\u201d Miller says about his work with nonprofits. That\u2019s not to say he wasn\u2019t plagued by financial anxiety &#8212; life without a steady salary took some getting used to &#8212; but it felt good to regain his sense of purpose. As he puts it, \u201cI\u2019m a doer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finding resilience in a difficult childhood.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To understand how Miller was able to build this new life for himself after Somerset, it\u2019s important to know his exposure to mental illness didn\u2019t start at Somerset Medical. As a boy, Miller was emotionally abused by his father, who he claims suffered from a \u201csevere personality disorder.\u201d Their relationship was so strained that at one point, in an effort to protect his mother, Miller says he tried to kill him with a butter knife. Intensely depressed, at age 20 he checked himself into a psychiatric hospital. It was a turning point in his life. He stopped taking drugs, went on to receive degrees from Rutgers and Columbia University\u2019s School of Public Health, got married and had children. Therapy was a constant throughout.<\/p>\n<p>Following Cullen\u2019s arrest and his subsequent dismissal, however, these childhood demons resurfaced. \u201cOne of my challenges during this [post-Somerset Medical] phase of my life was finally addressing my real issue of self-worth and identity,\u201d he writes in his latest book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Moppin-Floors-CEO-Hopelessness-Happiness\/dp\/1504980026\" target=\"_blank\"><em><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large\">Moppin&#8217; Floors to CEO<\/span><\/em><\/a>. \u201cFor too long my sense of \u2018self\u2019 was based on external factors such as title, income, recognition and what others thought of me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Related: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/03\/leaders-motivate-teams\/\" target=\"_blank\">How the Best Leaders Motivate Their Teams<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Miller believes this painful soul searching ultimately turned him into a more compassionate and effective consultant and leader. His clients often tell him he has an ability to see their future before they do, a \u201cunique skill set\u201d he attributes to \u201cthe tragedy I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The experience also made him acutely aware of the dangers of stigmatizing mental illness in the workplace, which not only injures employees\u2019 well being but also hurts productivity and, by extension, a company\u2019s bottom line. At Somerset, he recalls his own experience being embarrassed when sitting in a therapist\u2019s waiting room. What if someone found out? He was a CEO, after all.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe new thing I\u2019m recommending people do is have a cultural change within the organization. Let\u2019s stop stigmatizing it. Let\u2019s have a discussion about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to talk about it if you\u2019re depressed. Let\u2019s have an open discussion so people feel if they\u2019re overburdened with family life problems that they can go to someone in the company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miller has begun anew and he is bringing a depth to his work that he says is only possible after staring down chilling adversity.<\/p>\n<p>He can\u2019t undo the past. But he says he\u2019s doing his best to create a better future.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 08:45:18","updated":"2016-05-09 08:45:18","minute":"8:45 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/life-after-employing-a-killer\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/life-after-employing-a-killer\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/life-after-employing-a-killer\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"How a CEO Found His Way Forward After Employing a Serial Killer","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-164792404.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Getty Images","caption":"Charles Cullen, i.e. &quot;the Angel of Death.&quot;","attach_id":"1650288"},"excerpt":"The so-called \u201cAngel of Death\u201d worked under Dennis C.

His care-givers were &#8220;a den of spies and co-conspirators of Shari Redstone,&#8221; the filing argues, &#8220;all working together to remove Herzer and take control of Redstone for their own financially-motivated (and sometimes competing) reasons.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Herzer&#8217;s attorneys presented testimony on Friday from geriatric psychiatrist Stephen Read, who said that Redstone had dementia.<\/p>\n<p>Read said he examined Redstone earlier this year on Herzer&#8217;s behalf. Among other tasks, Read said he asked Redstone to identify colored shapes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He did very poorly,&#8221; Read said, pointing at a green square when asked to point to a blue star. Read also said that Redstone has &#8220;uncontrollable outbursts of anger,&#8221; which interfere with his ability to reason.<\/p>\n<p>If the case goes forward, the judge will hear on Monday from Keryn Redstone, a granddaughter of the mogul who is siding with Herzer. In court filings, 34-year-old Keryn Redstone said her grandfather had become a &#8220;prisoner in his own home&#8221; after Herzer was suddenly ejected from the mansion in October.<\/p>\n<p>When she last saw her grandfather in February, &#8220;he just sat there, staring into space,&#8221; Keryn Redstone said.<\/p>\n<p>A month ago, the two sides had reached a preliminary settlement agreement that would have awarded Herzer about $30 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. Those talks fell apart and the case proceeded to trial.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 06:14:11","updated":"2016-05-09 06:14:11","minute":"6:14 AM

That was the theme of John F. Kennedy\u2019s <em>Profiles in Courage<\/em>, and many historians have made the same point. For a reminder of how following the populace rather than leading it can be disastrous, turn your attention to the Philippines, where the polls in the presidential election closed not long ago. As I write, Rodrigo Duterte is reported to be well ahead with two-thirds of the votes counted, and if you haven\u2019t been following this race, you won\u2019t believe how he has become the likely victor.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the Philippines have been a democracy since 1986, when Corazon Aquino, mother of current President Benigno Aquino III, was elected president. By law, he can\u2019t run for re-election, and he urged the other candidates to unite against Duterte, but they refused; Duterte needs only a plurality to win. At his campaign rallies, which in some cases attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters, he essentially promised to end democracy \u2013 to declare \u201ca revolutionary government\u201d \u2013 if congress thwarts his will. He bragged about overseeing the killing of hundreds of alleged criminals, without trials, as mayor of the the city of Davao, and he promised to kill thousands more \u2013 to \u201cfill Manila Bay with their bodies\u201d \u2013 to impose order if elected president.<\/p>\n<p>In his heavily Catholic country he called Pope Francis \u201cthe son of a whore,\u201d and he routinely dismisses critics in language you will not read on Fortune.com. He made a joke about an Australian nun who was raped and killed in the Philippines; when the ambassadors of Australia and the U.S. objected, he told them to \u201cshut up.\u201d He angrily denied media reports that he had a secret bank account filled with wealth from payoffs until a journalist proved its existence by making a deposit. He then admitted it, shrugged, and made a joke.<\/p>\n<p>His followers love all of it. The more he insults everyone in power and promises to blow up the system, the more popular he becomes. The Philippine economy has been growing smartly, but millions of Filipinos remain grindingly poor, and rampant crime makes their lives miserable. They\u2019re desperate for a candidate who talks like them and promises the magic of a sudden solution to their problems, and never mind the niceties of how he\u2019d do it. His supporters are not a majority of Filipinos; polls show that they\u2019re only about 30% of the voting public. But under the rules, that may be enough.<\/p>\n<p>Duterte gave them exactly what they wanted, and he is probably the Philippines\u2019 next president. But his tough-talking campaign strategy was the opposite of courage. It\u2019s often said that bullies are the biggest cowards, and he\u2019s a stellar example.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 12:14:02","updated":"2016-05-09

During the company&#8217;s annual developer conference in San Francisco, CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the new software tool when a drone flew on stage while broadcasting the drone&#8217;s camera footage to a large screen via Facebook&#8217;s Live Video. It&#8217;s still lacking a consumer-facing feature like that of Periscope, but presumably, Facebook hopes drone companies will soon put the tool to use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Periscope is also taking a page from Facebook&#8217;s live video book and shifting away from videos being short-lived. After introducing a hashtag last week to let users permanently save their video broadcasts, Periscope now says that videos will soon be saved automatically and permanently by default. Users can, of course, also switch back to having their videos disappear after 24 hours as they did before.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 12:00:12","updated":"2016-05-09 12:00:12","minute":"12:00 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/periscope-dji-drone-video\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/periscope-dji-drone-video\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/periscope-dji-drone-video\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Periscope's New Drone Video Broadcast Feature Lets You Pretend to Be a Bird","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/drone.png?w=780&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy of Periscope","caption":"","attach_id":"1651389"},"excerpt":"<p>Owners of DJI drones can have a whole lot of fun with this feature. <\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1024641","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/kia-kokalitcheva\/","name":"Kia Kokalitcheva","twitter":"imkialikethecar","gplus":"","email":"kia.kokalitcheva@fortune.com","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kokalitcheva-kia.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Kia Kokalitcheva\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kokalitcheva-kia.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Kia Kokalitcheva is a reporter at <em>Fortune<\/em>.

A teacher hailed a car from her school on May 2 and was later robbed and killed. Didi helped police track down the 24-year-old driver the next day. Some users on Weibo have said they are boycotting Didi until it puts in place stricter screening for drivers, though the tone of many users is more shock and condemnation for the act. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"4\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4881921068001-4\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4881921068001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/24FKVaw\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dapple%2Cgoogle%2Cnetflix%2Cstreamingtv%2Ctv%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dapple&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">About a month before the murder, Chinese media said the local Shenzhen government required Didi and other ride-hailing apps to improve background checks on drivers after it found more than 3,000 drivers in the city had a history of drug use and \u2018significant\u2019 criminal records.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A Didi spokeswoman says the company started regular driver reviews last year based upon updates from national criminal databases and user ratings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i><\/i><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Drivers who are found to have defective records, or who have failed to have their driver license\/vehicle registration\/ID renewed in the latest review will be urged to go through a re-verification process in person with Didi,&#8221; the company says. It said last week it would not deflect responsibility for the murder on its platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The homicide follows a string of recent incidents involving Didi drivers, of which 14 million work in China. In April, a Guangzhou Didi driver was sentenced to prison for raping a passenger. A month before, a Didi driver in Wuhan was sentenced to eight years for the rape and robbery of a female passenger. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Uber has also faced criticism for its drivers. One went on a killing spree in Michigan in February, and sexual assaults have been alleged from Canada to India. The company has responded that its background checks are thorough, but added an emergency button for its India service. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It is a truth of the sharing economy that hundreds of millions of contractors are difficult to manage. But Didi will likely face more pressure this year to prove the safety of its service in China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the same time it\u2019s generating negative publicity, Didi is <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/06\/didi-kuaidi-funding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">reportedly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> close to raising $2 billion from its backers at a $25 billion valuation, up from a previous $16 billion valuation earlier this year. Didi is said to be losing more than $1 billion a year as it faces off against Uber for market share. Didi is winning so far with more than two-thirds of China\u2019s ride market but Uber is expanding quickly in the country that CEO Travis <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Kalanick says is its top overseas priority<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 07:29:20","updated":"2016-05-09 07:29:20","minute":"7:29 AM

Here&#8217;s a Q&amp;A in plain English about what you need to know about the case, including each side&#8217;s strategy and possible outcomes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are Google and Oracle in court?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The case is about intellectual property. It began six years ago when Oracle sued Google for using APIs tied to Java (more on this below) without permission. Google won at an initial trial in 2012 when a jury found the company didn&#8217;t infringe Oracle&#8217;s patents, and a judge concluded the APIs didn&#8217;t qualify for copyright protection.<\/p>\n<p>But in a ruling that shocked the tech community, an appeals court found in 2014 that Oracle&#8217;s APIs were indeed covered by copyright. The ruling also kicked the case back to the lower court to determine whether Google&#8217;s use of the APIs counted as a &#8220;fair use.&#8221; Now, at this second trial, a jury will look at the fair use question.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does &#8220;fair use&#8221; come into it? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fair use is a part of copyright law that allows use of a work without the author&#8217;s permission. Examples are parody sketches that use famous TV or movie characters, or a book review that quotes a section of a a novel. The Oracle-Google trial is unusual because you normally see fair use debates in the realm of media and the arts, not computer science.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the legal standard is the same. It consists of a <a href=\"http:\/\/fairuse.stanford.edu\/overview\/fair-use\/four-factors\/\">four-part test<\/a> that weighs: 1) the purpose of the use (i.e. Why did you use it?); 2) the nature of the work (i.e. How much creativity was involved?) 3) the amount used (How much did you take?); 4) the effect on the market for the work.<\/p>\n<p>While courts weigh all the factors, many legal scholars think numbers one (purpose) and four (effect on market) are the only ones that really matter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the case so important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s partly about the money. Oracle wants a jury to order Google, which is now part of the holding company Alphabet, to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/28\/oracle-google-legal-billions\/\">pay $9.3 <em>billion<\/em> <\/a>in damages. That figure is more than half of Google&#8217;s overall profits from 2015. But it&#8217;s unlikely Oracle, if it wins, will get even close to that amount.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger issue, instead, is the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/02\/24\/google-renews-push-for-fair-use-of-apis-before-oracle-trial\/\">fair use one<\/a>. If the jury sides finds Google&#8217;s activities were not fair use, it could be open season on other software companies, big and small, that rely on unlicensed APIs.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, developers have long treated APIs as a standard set of instructions outside the realm of copyright. Now, if Google loses, they could have to seek a license or basically reinvent the wheel every time they want one computer program to interact with another. As prominent computer scientists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/files\/filenode\/2013.1021.1022.computer.scientists.amici_.brief_.pdf\">told the appeals court<\/a>, allowing companies to assert copyright over APIs could have a profound and negative effect on software innovation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are these APIs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An API, which is short for Application Programming Interface, is a set of instructions that allow one type of software talk to another. For instance, you might have seen Google Maps built into a third party app or a &#8220;tweet this&#8221; button on a web page \u2014 this only works because Google and Twitter provided an API to make the app and website work with their software. (Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.pearson.com\/blog\/whats-api-3-ways-explain-it\">non-technical <\/a>explanation).<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Oracle, it controls libraries of APIs tied to the popular programming language Java. When Google began adding Java features to its Android software in 2007, it replicated portions of those APIs because developers were already familiar with them. Those portions related to headers and sequences\u2014they act kind of like a table of contents that shows what goes where.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will Google argue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google will tell the jury that its use of the APIs was transformative under the first part of the four-part test. Specifically, it will argue that its use of the Java APIs for a mobile operating system was a new and original purpose outside. The company will also argue that APIs rank low on the creativity scale and that it will used a very amount of the overall code controlled by Oracle\u2014thus, the second and third parts of the test favor Google. Finally, it will say the market harm part of the test favors Google because no one was using the APIs for mobile devices in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Google will also try to frame this as a story of greed on the part of Oracle, accusing its rival of trying to do through litigation what it can&#8217;t do through innovation. It will cast itself as the champion of the tech community and software developers, who will suffer if Oracle can copyright APIs.<\/p>\n<p>As a fall back plan, Google is also relying on other defenses besides fair use. Specifically, this will involve asking U.S. District Judge William Alsup to find Oracle can&#8217;t sue in the first place because it waited too long and because it once implied to Google that it wouldn&#8217;t sue (legal arguments known as laches and estoppel).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will Oracle argue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, Oracle will put a very different gloss on the four fair use factors. It will tell the jury Google did nothing transformative with the APIs but simply lifted them to make money. It will claim the APIs represent a lot of skill and creativity, and that Google used thousands of lines of its code without permission, which is no small amount. Finally, it will say the success of Android shows clear harm in the market\u2014i.e. that Oracle would have been able to collect millions in licensing fees but didn&#8217;t since Google simply took the APIs.<\/p>\n<p>Oracle will also rebut Google&#8217;s story of innovation by painting its rival as a lawless company that just took what it wanted rather than play by the rules. It will argue that Google&#8217;s claims of principles are just a smokescreen to cover up the fact that it was in a rush to build its Android system and took a shortcut by stealing Oracle&#8217;s code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will the jury decide?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Juries are often swayed by stories and emotions more than by dry legal arguments. This means that the outcome may turn less on a sober analysis of the fair use factors and instead on how they feel about each company. Is Google defending innovation against Oracle&#8217;s greed? Or did Google just disregard the rules for the sake of its own self-interest?<\/p>\n<p>The judge, who found for Google the first time around, will have a role to play, too, through his instructions and how he steers the trial. He could also sidestep the jury&#8217;s fair use finding by deciding the case on one of the other defenses (laches or estoppel) described above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long will this take?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The jury selection starts on Monday, and the case is expected to last weeks. The first portion of the trial will focus on the fair use arguments. If the jury sides with Oracle, the trial will then move to a damages phase to see how much Google should pay. At this point, Google would also set out its other defenses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will there be another appeal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty good bet. If Google loses, it will have to appeal once again to the Federal Circuit of Appeals, whose job is ordinarily to oversee patent claims\u2014and which many blame for botching the original ruling. This would likely be a stepping stone to the Supreme Court, which refused to get involved the first time around over the question of whether APIs can be copyrighted in the first place. Given the importance of the case, and an ongoing debate over fair use, there&#8217;s a good chance the country&#8217;s top court may end up hearing the case after all.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 09:35:11","updated":"2016-05-09 09:35:11","minute":"9:35 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/google-oracle-fair-use\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/google-oracle-fair-use\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/google-oracle-fair-use\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Guide to Google and Oracle's $9B Fair Use Fight","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4884850827001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4884850827001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/276l1LV\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dapi%2Cfairuse%2Cgoogle%2Cgoogleoraclecourt%2Coracle%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dgoogle&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/google.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by LEON NEAL AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"1651964"},"class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":"For a case that began six years ago "},"featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/google.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by LEON NEAL AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"1651964"},"excerpt":"What you need to know.

According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/sverigesradio.se\/sida\/artikel.aspx?programid=4042&amp;artikel=6424288\">joint letter<\/a> signed last week by 27 Swedish broadcasters, publishers and media associations, the model is a &#8220;direct attack on net neutrality&#8221; that could ultimately lead to higher prices for accessing the open Internet.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <em>Fortune\u2019s<\/em> technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>They wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What Telia and Facebook are creating here is a self-perpetuating closed system&mdash;a dominant player in the media industry (Facebook) makes a deal with a dominant player in the telecom industry (Telia), giving Facebook an advantage over all other media players that are dependent on the Internet, while giving Telia an advantage over other telecom companies.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been working on a drone traffic management system and will pass its research to the FAA in 2019 for further testing.<\/p>\n<p>In the push for autonomous cars and trucks, companies like Google and Daimler have turned to individual states such as Nevada, which has issued licenses for testing on its roads. But the FAA controls all U.S. airspace, so permits on a state-by-state basis will not suffice for drone testing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You really do have to make sure the FAA is in the boat and we are really focused on that piece of it more than anything,&#8221; said Mark Wallace, UPS&#8217; senior vice president for global engineering. As part of its strategy, UPS has invested in Boston-based drone manufacturer CyPhy Works.<\/p>\n<p>UPS will focus on projects like Rwanda and testing drones in remote U.S. areas in the near-term, he added.<\/p>\n<p>Walmart said last year it plans to test drones for package delivery.<\/p>\n<p>The retailer is &#8220;more likely to start with short hops&#8221; in rural areas, spokesman Dan Toporek said. &#8220;It has to happen a step at a time, which will teach us, and will provide insights to the FAA and the public on &#8216;this is how it could work.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Google referred Reuters to previous statements that the company hopes to operate a delivery service by 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Data from companies like No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, could also prove valuable, said Logan Campbell, chief executive of drone consulting firm Aerotas. BNSF has an exemption from the FAA to operate drones out of the line of sight along its rail network.<\/p>\n<p>Campbell said while drone manufacturers would like to see the FAA move faster, the &#8220;nightmare scenario&#8221; would be if a drone crashed into a manned aircraft.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to get this right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we move too fast and there&#8217;s an

And their gray-suited operators. Who are fluent in Polish.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the possibilities for commercial drones expands, it looks like regulation will be one of the key factors in allowing how fast new applications are rolled out (or not rolled out).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consultants PwC are launching a new service this week to help clients in construction and real estate development survey land and buildings.  They&#8217;re starting it out in Poland, because it&#8217;s one of only two countries (according to the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/5ea4c668-1364-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173.html#axzz4897rCRLi\">Financial Times<\/a><\/em>), that have drafted a comprehensive set of regulations to deal with the implications of drone use&#8211;regulations that, crucially, allow them to be operated beyond the actual line of sight of the operator. The other country is South Africa, the <em>FT<\/em> says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For comparison, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/13\/heres-where-commercial-drones-are-most-likely-buzzing-overhead\/\">just over 3,000 permits<\/a> for the operation of commercial drones across the U.S. so far, but the real explosion in drone use is expected to come later this year when releases a more comprehensive set of regulations: for now, their use in the U.S. is largely restricted to extremely specialized areas: small businesses hold 90% of all so-called &#8216;Section 333 exemptions&#8217;, and the vast majority of those have fewer than 10 employees (a significant number have just one employee) and take in less than $1 million a year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">PwC&#8217;s surveying drones fall into the category of activity that is all about delivering high-quality data in real-time (rather than, for example, the delivery of payloads by the likes of Amazon or Japan&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/11\/japan-drones-home-deliveries-urban\/\">Rakuten<\/a>). They&#8217;ll use high-resolution cameras, sensors and geo-locational devices to spot any defects in a building&#8217;s construction, as well as assess external factors such as a building&#8217;s immediate environment, according to the company.<\/p>\n<figure><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-12-47-26.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1651597\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-12-47-26.png?w=570&#038;h=197\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-05-09 at 12.47.26\" width=\"570\" height=\"197\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Source: PWC<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\">In that respect, they&#8217;re part of a broader set of tasks relating to infrastructure maintenance, a market that <a href=\"http:\/\/pwc.blogs.com\/press_room\/2016\/05\/global-market-for-commercial-applications-of-drone-technology-valued-at-over-127bn.html\">PwC thinks is worth around $45 billion a year, out of a total market of $127 billion<\/a>.

than when he graduated from college more than 30 years ago, citing his historic election as &#8220;one indicator of how attitudes have changed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But gaps persist, he told Howard University&#8217;s Class of 2016, citing racism and inequality as examples.<\/p>\n<p>In a commencement speech at one of the nation&#8217;s leading historically black schools, Obama said there were no black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and few black judges when Columbia University awarded him a bachelor&#8217;s degree in 1983.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of folks didn&#8217;t even think blacks had the tools to be a quarterback,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;When I was graduating, the main black hero on TV was Mr. T. Rap and hip-hop were counterculture, underground. Now Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday night and Beyonce runs the world.&#8221; Rhimes is the executive producer of television hits &#8220;Scandal&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; which air on Thursdays.<\/p>\n<p>Today, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re no longer entertainers. We&#8217;re producers, studio executives. No longer small-business owners, we&#8217;re CEOs. We&#8217;re mayors, representatives&#8221; \u2014 and someone in the crowd shouted out, &#8220;President.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying gaps do not persist. Obviously, they do,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;Racism persists, inequality persists.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He called on the university&#8217;s 2,300 graduates to step up and take on the work of closing those gaps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;America needs you to gladly, happily take up that work &#8230; so enjoy the party, because you&#8217;re going to be busy,&#8221; Obama said.<\/p>\n<p>He cited income inequality, an issue in the presidential campaign to choose his successor in November, as well as disparities in unemployment, pay and criminal justice. He also listed disease and conflict worldwide, along with terrorism and climate change as other issues needing attention.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So make no mistake, Class of 2016. You&#8217;ve got plenty of work to do,&#8221; said Obama, who was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree. &#8220;But as complicated and sometimes intractable as these challenges may seem, the truth is that your generation is better positioned than any before you to meet those challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;America is a better place today than it was when I graduated from college,&#8221; Obama said, adding &#8220;by almost every measure.&#8221; He said the country &#8220;also happens to be better off than when I took office, but that&#8217;s a longer story.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The line drew cheers and applause. &#8220;That&#8217;s a different discussion for another speech,&#8221; Obama said.<\/p>\n<p>Obama told the graduates to be confident and embrace being African-American and all that it entails, including &#8220;our particular awareness of injustice and unfairness and struggle. That means we cannot sleepwalk through life. We cannot be ignorant of history. We cannot meet the world with a sense of entitlement.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He urged them to vote and not to fear opposing voices. Many in the audience of about 15,000 chanted &#8220;four more years&#8221; as Obama received the degree. He cited low voter turnout in general and among younger voters in particular for control of Congress switching from Democratic to Republican during his presidency.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I&#8217;ve got to deal with,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;And then people are wondering, well, how come Obama hasn&#8217;t gotten this done? Just vote. It&#8217;s math.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Obama, 54, opened by telling the graduates that most of them were just starting high school when he was first elected in 2008.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I used to joke about being old. Now I realize I&#8217;m old. It&#8217;s not a joke anymore,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The address was the first of three commencement speeches Obama has scheduled this spring, his final ones as president.<\/p>\n<p>Obama is set to speak May 15 at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and June 2 at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 09:19:05","updated":"2016-05-09 09:19:05","minute":"9:19 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/obama-says-beyonce-runs-the-world\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/obama-says-beyonce-runs-the-world\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/obama-says-beyonce-runs-the-world\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Obama Says Beyonce Runs the World","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-528986082.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"Al Drago CQ-Roll Call,Inc.","caption":"President Barack Obama speaks during the 148th commencement ceremony at Howard University May 7, 2016 in Washington, DC.","attach_id":1651684},"excerpt":"<p>And Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday nights.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1639681","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/associated-press\/","name":"The Associated Press","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":384,"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":130744,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News about the business of entertainment, including the music, film and TV industries, as well as the celebrities and people who work in them.

And TV news producers know it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exhibit A: KTVU News report from last year stating that drinking one to three glasses of champagne per week may delay the onset of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cFantastic news!\u201d an anchorman snorted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo it isn\u2019t!\u201d said Oliver. \u201cAside from the fact that if you are celebrating with champagne three times a week, your standards of celebration need to be much higher!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More to the point, it turns out that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23458470\">widely cited study<\/a> was conducted on rats. Which is problematic considering tests conducted on lab rodents are not always applicable to humans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow do you not tell people that? And how do you not show them photos of the experiments?\u201d Oliver railed, cutting away to a supposed photo of the experiments: a pair of hipster rats wearing fashionable hats and holding flutes of champagne near giant lines of cocaine. \u201cThose are chic rats!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Even Ted Talks are suspect<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Oliver made clear that \u201cmorning show-style science\u201d isn\u2019t the exclusive province of television. He pointed toward a 2011 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin?language=en\">Ted Talk<\/a> by Paul Zak, during which the neuroeconomist extolled a \u201cmoral molecule:&#8221; the hormone oxytocin which is manufactured by the human body during a certain physical exchange. \u201cHere\u2019s your prescription from Dr. Love,\u201d Zak says, referring to himself in the third person in a clip from the Ted Talk. \u201cEight hugs a day. We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">READ: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/18\/john-oliver-lead-poisoning-flint\/?iid=leftrail\">HBO&#8217;s John Oliver Uses &#8216;Sesame Street&#8217; to Shame Congress Over Lead Crisis<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Grimacing, Oliver proceeded to gleefully shred &#8220;Dr. Love.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t call yourself Dr. Love,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the name a tabloid gives a dentist who ejaculated on his sedated patients. And second, there\u2019s no way I would be happier giving eight hugs a day. I\u2019m English! That\u2019s four lifetimes\u2019 worth of hugs.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From there, Oliver pointed out another scientific research paper from the journal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com\/\">Biological Psychiatry<\/a> views the idea of increased oxytocin leading to increased happiness \u201cwith skepticism.\u201d Ergo: \u201cWhen a stranger calling himself Dr. Love offers to hug you eight times a day, say no!\u201d the comedian exclaimed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Up next on &#8220;Today&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oliver saved his most potent vitriol for NBC\u2019s <i>Today<\/i> which \u201clives for scientific studies\u201d according to its own self-description. That much was teed up in a clip featuring co-hosts Natalie Morales and Tamron Hall gently arguing about the health benefits of whole milk vis a vis scientific studies regarding its pros and cons. They were interrupted by weatherman Al Roker, who opined: \u201cYou find the study that sounds best to you. And go with that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d Oliver said, slamming his hand against his desk. \u201cIf you start thinking that science is a la carte and if you don\u2019t like it, another study will be along soon, that is what leads people to believe man-made climate change isn\u2019t real. Or that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/29\/robert-de-niro-anti-vaccine-documentary\/\">vaccines cause autism<\/a>\u2014both of which the scientific consensus is pretty clear on.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs science bullshit?\u201d Oliver asked at one point. \u201cNo, but there is a lot of bullshit currently masquerading as science.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Watch the entire segment below:<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0Rnq1NpHdmw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/__ChrisLee\">Chris Lee<\/a> is a former staff writer for<\/em>Entertainment Weekly, The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek<em> and<\/em>The Daily Beas<em>t.

look at the personal wealth portfolios of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump, how they earned their money over the years and the lifestyles they spend it on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hillary Clinton<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House when George W. Bush was inaugurated president in January 2001, a period that Hillary Clinton later described as so financially perilous they were &#8220;dead broke.&#8221; The Clintons cited legal bills and other liabilities between $2 million and nearly $11 million. But within just one year, according to tax and disclosure records, they had wiped out all that debt, earning nearly $12 million. It was the start of an infusion of wealth that enriched the couple by more than $200 million over 15 years \u2014 and nearly $140 million since 2007.<\/p>\n<p>The Clintons leveraged public service, celebrity status, book-writing, consulting and a whirlwind of lucrative speeches that took them across the country and around the world on behalf of corporations, foundations, trade groups and even some foreign governments.<\/p>\n<p>Bill Clinton blended private appearances and consulting with his work promoting the family&#8217;s global charity, the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton ran for the presidency in 2008, lost to Barack Obama, became his secretary of state for four years then joined her husband at the foundation and on the lecture circuit, earning $22 million by herself in three years.<\/p>\n<p>Their largesse has provided the trappings of a glamorous life.<\/p>\n<p>The Clintons own well-appointed houses in the suburbs of New York and in the nation&#8217;s capital. They hold a sole mutual fund worth between $5 million and $25 million.

Trump has also made the entirely plausible claim last year that, &#8220;I have a Gucci store that&#8217;s worth more than Romney.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Trump has described himself as a largely self-made man who parlayed a $1 million loan from his father into an empire worth billions. Trump&#8217;s eventual inheritance was far larger than that, however, and Trump relied on his father&#8217;s loan guarantees for his formative real estate and casino deals.<\/p>\n<p>He came close to losing it all in the early 1990s, when personal guarantees of a floundering casino and real estate empire put his fate in the hands of bankers who had loaned him money. Even then, however, Trump maintained a remarkable standard of living: The bankers gave him a $450,000-a-month allowance.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no such limit on Trump&#8217;s spending these days. Living out of a three-story penthouse atop the Trump Tower, he also owns residences in California, Florida, Virginia and the Caribbean. Caviar, yachts, gold-plated faucets, private jets and mansions with 126 rooms: If there&#8217;s a public signifier of wealth, it&#8217;s a safe bet that Trump has associated himself with it.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 05:47:03","updated":"2016-05-09 05:47:03","minute":"5:47 AM

Tim Cook has made seven major television appearances since taking the helm, often after the company&#8217;s stock price has been lagging. But while the share price tends to rebound slightly in the few days after Cook&#8217;s TV interviews, it trails behind the market over the next few months, according to Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co.<\/p>\n<p>Apple shares trailed behind the Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index by 4.4% in the two weeks leading up to a Cook TV spot, according to Sacconaghi. The day after such an appearance, the stock outperformed the index by 0.9% and by 0.8% after three days. But Apple shares trailed the S&amp;P 500 by an average of 5.2% one month after Cook was on TV and by 7.8% after three months.<\/p>\n<p>Cook appeared on Jim Cramer&#8217;s CNBC show <em>Mad Money<\/em> on May 2 after shares of Apple had been mired in an eight-day losing streak on the stock market\u2014the longest since 1998.<\/p>\n<p>That prompted long-time Apple analyst Sacconaghi to query if such appearances indicated things might be improving behind the scenes, but his research showed just the opposite. Cook took over the helm at Apple in August 2011 and has since done only limited public interviews on video streaming or TV, including Charlie Rose&#8217;s PBS show <em>The Week<\/em> in 2014 and 2015 and an appearance on ABC News in February.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>&#8216;s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cook&#8217;s television appears have generally attempted to soothe prevailing investor concerns, and Apple&#8217;s stock has initially typically reacted neutrally or somewhat positively to the public appearances historically, as it did last week,&#8221; he wrote in a report on Monday. &#8220;However, generally, the public appearance\/associated commentary has not been a good leading indicator for the stock over longer periods.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the four trading days after Cook&#8217;s latest appearance, shares of Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"aapl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple-5\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">aapl<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> lost 1% matching the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

He pointed toward a 2011 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin?language=en\">Ted Talk<\/a> by Paul Zak, during which the neuroeconomist extolled a \u201cmoral molecule:&#8221; the hormone oxytocin which is manufactured by the human body during a certain physical exchange. \u201cHere\u2019s your prescription from Dr. Love,\u201d Zak says, referring to himself in the third person in a clip from the Ted Talk. \u201cEight hugs a day.

That\u2019s four lifetimes\u2019 worth of hugs.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From there, Oliver pointed out another scientific research paper from the journal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com\/\">Biological Psychiatry<\/a> views the idea of increased oxytocin leading to increased happiness \u201cwith skepticism.\u201d Ergo: \u201cWhen a stranger calling himself Dr. Love offers to hug you eight times a day, say no!\u201d the comedian exclaimed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Up next on &#8220;Today&#8221;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oliver saved his most potent vitriol for NBC\u2019s <i>Today<\/i> which \u201clives for scientific studies\u201d according to its own self-description. That much was teed up in a clip featuring co-hosts Natalie Morales and Tamron Hall gently arguing about the health benefits of whole milk vis a vis scientific studies regarding its pros and cons.

No matter how they reengineered the process, there were always leaks because third parties were involved. Paying with credit cards over the Internet was insecure because users had to divulge too much personal data, and the transaction fees were too high for small payments. In 1998, Nick Szabo wrote a short paper entitled \u201cThe God Protocol.\u201d Szabo mused about the creation of a be-all end-all technology protocol, one that designated God the trusted third party in the middle of all transactions. His point was powerful: Doing business on the Internet requires a leap of faith.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width:44%;float:right;margin-left:25px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/blockchain-revolution-cover.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1649600\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/blockchain-revolution-cover.jpg?w=789&#038;h=1200\" alt=\"blockchain revolution cover\" width=\"789\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Cover image, Blockchain Revolution<\/span><\/div>\n<p>A decade later in 2008, the global financial industry crashed. Perhaps propitiously, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto\u2013who may or may not be an Australian entrepreneur named Craig Wright\u2013outlined a new protocol for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using a cryptocurrency, or digital currency, called Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are different from traditional fiat currencies because they are not created or controlled by countries. This protocol established a set of rules\u2014in the form of distributed computations\u2014that ensured the integrity of the data exchanged among these billions of devices without going through a trusted third party. This seemingly subtle act set off a spark that has excited, terrified, or otherwise captured the imagination of the computing world and has spread like wildfire everywhere.<br \/>\n\u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, this is it. This is the big breakthrough,\u2019\u201d said Marc Andreessen, the co-creator of the first commercial Web browser, Netscape, and a big investor in technology ventures. &#8220;This is the distributed trust network that the Internet always needed and never had.\u201d<br \/>\nToday thoughtful people everywhere are trying to understand the implications of a protocol that enables mere mortals to manufacture trust through clever code. This has never happened before\u2014trusted transactions directly between two or more parties, authenticated by mass collaboration and powered by collective self-interests, rather than by large corporations motivated by profit.<br \/>\nIt may not be the Almighty, but a trustworthy global platform for our transactions is something very big. We\u2019re calling it the Trust Protocol.<br \/>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"23\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4874698430001-23\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4874698430001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1rudwgY\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbitcoin%2Cbitcoincreator%2Ccraigwright%2Csatoshinakamoto%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><br \/>\nThis protocol is the foundation of a growing number of global distributed ledgers called blockchains\u2014of which the Bitcoin blockchain is the largest. While the technology is complicated, the main idea is simple. Blockchains enable us to send money directly and safely from me to you, without going through a bank, a credit card company, or PayPal.<br \/>\nRather than the Internet of Information, it\u2019s the Internet of Value or of Money. It\u2019s also a platform for everyone to know what is true\u2014at least with regard to structured recorded information. At its most basic, it is an open source code: anyone can download it for free, run it, and use it to develop new tools for managing transactions online. As such, it holds the potential for unleashing countless new applications and as yet unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform many things.<br \/>\nBig banks and some governments are implementing blockchains as distributed ledgers to revolutionize the way information is stored and transactions occur. Their goals are laudable\u2014speed, lower cost, security, fewer errors, and the elimination of central points of attack and failure. These models don\u2019t necessarily involve a cryptocurrency for payments.<br \/>\nHowever, the most important and far-reaching blockchains are based on the bitcoin model. Here\u2019s how they work.<br \/>\nBitcoin or other digital currency isn\u2019t saved in a file somewhere; it\u2019s represented by transactions recorded in a blockchain\u2014kind of like a global spreadsheet or ledger, which leverages the resources of a large peer-to-peer bitcoin network to verify and approve each Bitcoin transaction. Each blockchain, like the one that uses Bitcoin, is distributed: it runs on computers by volunteers around the world; there is no central database to hack. The blockchain is public: anyone can view it at any time because it resides on the network, not within a single institution charged with auditing transactions and keeping records. And the blockchain is encrypted: it uses heavy-duty encryption involving public and private keys\u2013like the two-key system to access a safety deposit box\u2013to maintain virtual security. You needn\u2019t worry about the weak firewalls of Target or Home Depot, or a thieving staffer of Morgan Stanley or the U.S. federal government.<br \/>\nEvery 10 minutes, all the transactions conducted are verified, cleared, and stored in a block that is linked to the preceding block, creating a chain. Each block must refer to the preceding block to be valid. This structure permanently time-stamps and stores exchanges of value, preventing anyone from altering the ledger. If you wanted to steal a Bitcoin, you\u2019d have to rewrite the coin\u2019s entire history on the blockchain in broad daylight. That\u2019s practically impossible. So the blockchain is a distributed ledger representing a network consensus of every transaction that has ever occurred. Like the World Wide Web of information, it\u2019s the World Wide Ledger of value\u2014a distributed ledger that everyone can download and run on their personal computer.<br \/>\nSome scholars have argued that the invention of double-entry bookkeeping enabled the rise of capitalism and the nation-state. This new digital ledger of economic transactions can be programmed to record virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, deeds and titles of ownership, financial accounts, votes, provenance of food, and anything else that can be expressed in code.<br \/>\nThe new platform enables a reconciliation of digital records regarding just about everything in real time. In fact, soon billions of smart things in the physical world will be sensing, responding, communicating, sharing important data, doing everything from protecting our environment to managing our health. This Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything. Business, commerce, and the economy need a Digital Reckoning.<br \/>\nSo why should you care? We believe the truth can set us free and distributed trust will profoundly affect people in all walks of life. Maybe you\u2019re a consumer who wants to know where that hamburger meat really came from. Perhaps you\u2019re an immigrant who\u2019s sick of paying big fees to send money home to loved ones. Maybe you\u2019re an aid worker who needs to identify land titles of landowners so you can rebuild their homes after an earthquake. Or a citizen fed up with the lack of transparency and accountability of political leaders. Or a user of social media who values your privacy and thinks all the data you generate might be worth something\u2014to you. Even as we write, innovators are building blockchain-based applications that serve these ends. And they are just the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>Reprinted from <em><a href=\"http:\/\/blockchain-revolution.com\/\">Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World <\/a><\/em>by Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott with permission of Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

Here&#8217;s a Q&amp;A in plain English about what you need to know about the case, including each side&#8217;s strategy and possible outcomes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are Google and Oracle in court?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The case is about intellectual property. It began six years ago when Oracle sued Google for using APIs tied to Java (more on this below) without permission. Google won at an initial trial in 2012 when a jury found the company didn&#8217;t infringe Oracle&#8217;s patents, and a judge concluded the APIs didn&#8217;t qualify for copyright protection.<\/p>\n<p>But in a ruling that shocked the tech community, an appeals court found in 2014 that Oracle&#8217;s APIs were indeed covered by copyright. The ruling also kicked the case back to the lower court to determine whether Google&#8217;s use of the APIs counted as a &#8220;fair use.&#8221; Now, at this second trial, a jury will look at the fair use question.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does &#8220;fair use&#8221; come into it? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fair use is a part of copyright law that allows use of a work without the author&#8217;s permission. Examples are parody sketches that use famous TV or movie characters, or a book review that quotes a section of a a novel. The Oracle-Google trial is unusual because you normally see fair use debates in the realm of media and the arts, not computer science.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, the legal standard is the same. It consists of a <a href=\"http:\/\/fairuse.stanford.edu\/overview\/fair-use\/four-factors\/\">four-part test<\/a> that weighs: 1) the purpose of the use (i.e. Why did you use it?); 2) the nature of the work (i.e. How much creativity was involved?) 3) the amount used (How much did you take?); 4) the effect on the market for the work.<\/p>\n<p>While courts weigh all the factors, many legal scholars think numbers one (purpose) and four (effect on market) are the only ones that really matter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the case so important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s partly about the money. Oracle wants a jury to order Google, which is now part of the holding company Alphabet, to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/28\/oracle-google-legal-billions\/\">pay $9.3 <em>billion<\/em> <\/a>in damages. That figure is more than half of Google&#8217;s overall profits from 2015. But it&#8217;s unlikely Oracle, if it wins, will get even close to that amount.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger issue, instead, is the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/02\/24\/google-renews-push-for-fair-use-of-apis-before-oracle-trial\/\">fair use one<\/a>. If the jury sides finds Google&#8217;s activities were not fair use, it could be open season on other software companies, big and small, that rely on unlicensed APIs.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, developers have long treated APIs as a standard set of instructions outside the realm of copyright. Now, if Google loses, they could have to seek a license or basically reinvent the wheel every time they want one computer program to interact with another. As prominent computer scientists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/files\/filenode\/2013.1021.1022.computer.scientists.amici_.brief_.pdf\">told the appeals court<\/a>, allowing companies to assert copyright over APIs could have a profound and negative effect on software innovation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are these APIs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An API, which is short for Application Programming Interface, is a set of instructions that allow one type of software talk to another. For instance, you might have seen Google Maps built into a third party app or a &#8220;tweet this&#8221; button on a web page \u2014 this only works because Google and Twitter provided an API to make the app and website work with their software. (Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.pearson.com\/blog\/whats-api-3-ways-explain-it\">non-technical <\/a>explanation).<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Oracle, it controls libraries of APIs tied to the popular programming language Java. When Google began adding Java features to its Android software in 2007, it replicated portions of those APIs because developers were already familiar with them. Those portions related to headers and sequences\u2014they act kind of like a table of contents that shows what goes where.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will Google argue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google will tell the jury that its use of the APIs was transformative under the first part of the four-part test. Specifically, it will argue that its use of the Java APIs for a mobile operating system was a new and original purpose outside. The company will also argue that APIs rank low on the creativity scale and that it will used a very amount of the overall code controlled by Oracle\u2014thus, the second and third parts of the test favor Google. Finally, it will say the market harm part of the test favors Google because no one was using the APIs for mobile devices in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Google will also try to frame this as a story of greed on the part of Oracle, accusing its rival of trying to do through litigation what it can&#8217;t do through innovation. It will cast itself as the champion of the tech community and software developers, who will suffer if Oracle can copyright APIs.<\/p>\n<p>As a fall back plan, Google is also relying on other defenses besides fair use. Specifically, this will involve asking U.S. District Judge William Alsup to find Oracle can&#8217;t sue in the first place because it waited too long and because it once implied to Google that it wouldn&#8217;t sue (legal arguments known as laches and estoppel).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will Oracle argue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, Oracle will put a very different gloss on the four fair use factors. It will tell the jury Google did nothing transformative with the APIs but simply lifted them to make money. It will claim the APIs represent a lot of skill and creativity, and that Google used thousands of lines of its code without permission, which is no small amount. Finally, it will say the success of Android shows clear harm in the market\u2014i.e. that Oracle would have been able to collect millions in licensing fees but didn&#8217;t since Google simply took the APIs.<\/p>\n<p>Oracle will also rebut Google&#8217;s story of innovation by painting its rival as a lawless company that just took what it wanted rather than play by the rules. It will argue that Google&#8217;s claims of principles are just a smokescreen to cover up the fact that it was in a rush to build its Android system and took a shortcut by stealing Oracle&#8217;s code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will the jury decide?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Juries are often swayed by stories and emotions more than by dry legal arguments. This means that the outcome may turn less on a sober analysis of the fair use factors and instead on how they feel about each company. Is Google defending innovation against Oracle&#8217;s greed? Or did Google just disregard the rules for the sake of its own self-interest?<\/p>\n<p>The judge, who found for Google the first time around, will have a role to play, too, through his instructions and how he steers the trial. He could also sidestep the jury&#8217;s fair use finding by deciding the case on one of the other defenses (laches or estoppel) described above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long will this take?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The jury selection starts on Monday, and the case is expected to last weeks. The first portion of the trial will focus on the fair use arguments. If the jury sides with Oracle, the trial will then move to a damages phase to see how much Google should pay. At this point, Google would also set out its other defenses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will there be another appeal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty good bet. If Google loses, it will have to appeal once again to the Federal Circuit of Appeals, whose job is ordinarily to oversee patent claims\u2014and which many blame for botching the original ruling. This would likely be a stepping stone to the Supreme Court, which refused to get involved the first time around over the question of whether APIs can be copyrighted in the first place. Given the importance of the case, and an ongoing debate over fair use, there&#8217;s a good chance the country&#8217;s top court may end up hearing the case after all.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 09:35:11","updated":"2016-05-09 09:35:11","minute":"9:35 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/google-oracle-fair-use\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/google-oracle-fair-use\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/google-oracle-fair-use\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Guide to Google and Oracle's $9B Fair Use Fight","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"25\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4884850827001-25\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4884850827001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/276l1LV\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dapi%2Cfairuse%2Cgoogle%2Cgoogleoraclecourt%2Coracle%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dgoogle&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/google.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by LEON NEAL AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"1651964"},"class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":"For a case that began six years ago "},"featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/google.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by LEON NEAL AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"","attach_id":"1651964"},"excerpt":"<p>What you need to know.

During the company&#8217;s annual developer conference in San Francisco, CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the new software tool when a drone flew on stage while broadcasting the drone&#8217;s camera footage to a large screen via Facebook&#8217;s Live Video. It&#8217;s still lacking a consumer-facing feature like that of Periscope, but presumably, Facebook hopes drone companies will soon put the tool to use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Periscope is also taking a page from Facebook&#8217;s live video book and shifting away from videos being short-lived. After introducing a hashtag last week to let users permanently save their video broadcasts, Periscope now says that videos will soon be saved automatically and permanently by default. Users can, of course, also switch back to having their videos disappear after 24 hours as they did before.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 12:00:12","updated":"2016-05-09 12:00:12","minute":"12:00 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/periscope-dji-drone-video\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/periscope-dji-drone-video\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/periscope-dji-drone-video\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Periscope's New Drone Video Broadcast Feature Lets You Pretend to Be a Bird","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/drone.png?w=780&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy of Periscope","caption":"","attach_id":"1651389"},"excerpt":"<p>Owners of DJI drones can have a whole lot of fun with this feature. <\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1024641","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/kia-kokalitcheva\/","name":"Kia Kokalitcheva","twitter":"imkialikethecar","gplus":"","email":"kia.kokalitcheva@fortune.com","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kokalitcheva-kia.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Kia Kokalitcheva\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kokalitcheva-kia.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Kia Kokalitcheva is a reporter at <em>Fortune<\/em>.

At CBS\u2019s annual gathering in Los Angeles that May, a curtain hid Redstone\u2014always too proud to use a wheelchair\u2014as burly men carried him onto the stage, where they deposited him into a seat beside the other directors.<\/p>\n<p>Since a hospitalization for pneumonia that September, Redstone, who has difficulty swallowing his own saliva, has labored to utter a sentence. Inside his Beverly Hills mansion, he requires a nurse to serve as his interpreter. CBS\u2019s Nov. 5 earnings call began with a halting \u201copening remark\u201d from Redstone: \u201cThis is Sumner. Welcome to the CBS Corp. event.\u201d Eight days later, he was heard, barely, on Viacom\u2019s quarterly conference call, weakly slurring eight words introducing CEO Philippe Dauman: \u201cGood morning everyone. Here\u2019s my wise friend, Philippe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtr1dft7.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648736\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtr1dft7.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=659\" alt=\"Viacom Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone addresses guests at the MTV studios in Istanbul\" width=\"1024\" height=\"659\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Sumner Redstone addresses guests at MTV&#8217;s Istanbul studios in 2006.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Fatih Saribas \u2014 Reuters<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Redstone attended his last company board meetings in person in 2014, too. According to a witness to one session, he dozed and drooled during the proceedings. At subsequent events, Redstone\u2019s fellow directors were routinely advised that he was listening in by phone from his hilltop mansion in Beverly Hills. But according to medical logs recorded by Redstone\u2019s round-the-clock nurses, sometimes he just slept.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>At 8:30 a.m. this Friday, in a windowless, sixth-floor courtroom in downtown Los Angeles, testimony will begin to resolve what would normally remain an exquisitely private matter: Who should make health care decisions for an old man when he\u2019s unable to make them for himself? Redstone is a man who, for decades, dominated those around him. Now diminished, by some accounts a wraith, he is not expected even to be in the courtroom at a trial that centers on what condition he\u2019s in. He will be questioned by each side for 15 minutes at home (the videotaped deposition will be shown only to the judge). Even that small amount of testimony might be too much for him.<\/p>\n<p>At center stage in the trial that begins Friday is Manuela Herzer, 51, Redstone\u2019s Argentine-born housemate-turned-castoff. Herzer instigated this court proceeding after she was ousted from Redstone&#8217;s mansion\u2014and from his will. Her lawyers will argue that Redstone was incapacitated and not competent to make such a decision and that, as a result, she should be restored to her place in his life (which would also restore her in his bequests).<\/p>\n<p>There will be testimony that Redstone, while continuing as executive chairman of Viacom and CBS was, in truth \u201ca living ghost\u201d\u2014largely reduced to tears and grunts, and incapable of plotting strategy for two giant public companies.<\/p>\n<p>We will likely hear about his delusional daily demands for steak and sex, and about scheduled visits to his gated Beverly Hills mansion by a woman paid to pretend to meet his carnal desires while a male nurse stood by watching. There will be testimony about the infidelity of the mogul\u2019s 44-year-old girlfriend, Sydney Holland, who shared Redstone\u2019s mansion; about his bitter estrangement from his daughter Shari; and Herzer\u2019s claim that Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, Redstone\u2019s intensely loyal prot\u00e9g\u00e9, lied to hide his boss\u2019s incapacity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-44\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"44\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Herzer, who asserts Redstone was non <em>compos mentis<\/em> and under undue influence last October when she was ordered out of his house and replaced as his health care agent, will swear that she is motivated purely by her love for him, that she\u2019s merely seeking to fulfill her vow to care for Redstone to his dying day.<\/p>\n<p>Lawyers representing the billionaire will tell a quite different tale. That the two women who lived in his house conspired to cut him off from family and friends. That Herzer is simply a cunning, stylish gold digger, who launched her legal jihad to preserve Redstone\u2019s $70-million bequest to her in his will. And that Redstone, despite his feeble speech, remains mentally competent to make his own decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, <em>Fortune<\/em> has learned that Redstone&#8217;s lawyers are planning to intensify the legal conflict even more. The lawyers confirm they will soon file a new suit against Herzer and Holland, claiming elder abuse, among other things, and seeking to reclaim nearly $150 million that the billionaire gave these women in recent years. (Lawyers for Holland and Herzer have adamantly denied any misconduct by their clients.)<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s beyond dispute is that this fight has sent shock waves through Redstone\u2019s vast empire. It was this tawdry case\u2014and not a planned corporate succession or steps taken by either board\u2014that forced his belated departure as chairman of the two companies in February, despite his repeated vows that he\u2019d never step down. (He also claimed he\u2019d never die.) It has focused attention on the business woes at Viacom, where profits are faltering, the creative and digital strategies seem suspect, and the stock has dropped 39% in the past year. And it has prompted CBS chief Leslie Moonves to start quietly maneuvering to get out from under the Redstone family\u2019s thumb altogether, according to a Reuters report. (&#8220;We look at everything that is available out there,&#8221; Moonves said when asked about the report on a recent earnings call. &#8220;We are not going to comment on any rumors that have been floating around.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>It also triggered the first salvos in a looming battle for control of the companies, where Redstone, despite it all, commands 80% of the voting shares. At CBS, Shari Redstone (who serves as vice chair of both companies) backed the board\u2019s decision in early February to award her father\u2019s executive chairman title to CEO Leslie Moonves. But at Viacom, she cast the lone vote against promoting the embattled Dauman, her father\u2019s anointed CEO, suggesting she wants to oust him.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15%;width:60%;padding-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_418044f.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648707\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_418044f.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1531\" alt=\"'THE ITALIAN JOB' FILM PREMIERE, HOLLYWOOD, AMERICA - 27 MAY 2003\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1531\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone at his 80th birthday party in 2003 as his daughter Shari and granddaughter Kim look on.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by E Charbonneau \u2014 BEI\/REX\/Shutterstock<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The trial might seem like a mere detour into the seamy details of a billionaire\u2019s decline. But in fact the corporate stakes are dramatically higher than that. In fact, the trial could lead to a change in control at both CBS and Viacom. A finding by the judge in the case that Redstone is not competent could trigger a provision in the trust that holds his 80% of the voting shares of both companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Control would then pass from Redstone to the trust\u2019s seven trustees. They include Shari Redstone and Dauman\u2014and several trustees whose future votes are uncertain. If she wins, Dauman might swiftly be gone. If Dauman prevails, he\u2019ll extend his influence beyond Viacom, to CBS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An already bitter conflict born of the maneuvers inside Redstone\u2019s household, it seems, could reshape $40 billion worth of corporations and the lives of thousands of employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>Sumner Redstone\u2019s personal and business lives have always been deeply\u2014often painfully\u2014intertwined. Redstone is an extraordinary man. He built an empire, changed the media landscape, popularized a business mantra (\u201cContent is king!\u201d), amassed a fortune, and has given generously to charity.<\/p>\n<p>But he\u2019s no storybook victim; he made himself an easy mark. If scheming women decades younger sought to pick his bulging pockets, Redstone\u2014who hungered for their adoring company\u2014virtually invited them to do so. And before anyone isolated the billionaire from family and friends, he drove many of them off himself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-45\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"45\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an epic saga. This account is based on interviews with dozens of people, including Herzer, current and former high-ranking executives of Viacom and CBS, people close to Redstone and his family, witnesses to events at his mansion, and lawyers in the case, as well as hundreds of pages of court records and documents. Three of the principals, Redstone, his daughter Shari, and Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, declined to be interviewed. However, representatives for each of them spoke to <em>Fortune<\/em> at length.

A mad king, obsessed with irrational lusts, sits at its center, oblivious to the chaos he has set in motion. Ancient feuds motivate scheming rivals, who claim to act in the king\u2019s name. Alliances are transactional and transitory. Spies loom. Betrayals abound. Romantic and personal ties often serve as a path to wealth and power. The sexual imagery is cringe worthy. Winter is finally coming to Sumner Redstone. The wise player in the game trusts no one.<\/p>\n<p>Redstone is a psychiatrist\u2019s field day: a mix of breathtaking self-absorption, brutal drive, and primal wants, steeped in a painful childhood. In 2006, while staying with relatives in New Jersey over the Christmas holidays, he was furious to discover the Dec. 24 TV broadcast of his beloved New England Patriots was to be blacked out in favor of the local New York Giants\u2019 game. Redstone knew there was a satellite dish on Viacom\u2019s jet, parked at the Morristown, N.J., airport. He ordered members of the flight crew out of their homes on the afternoon before Christmas to fire up the plane and have it towed out onto the tarmac, where he could get a strong enough signal to watch his game. And there everyone remained, late into the afternoon on Christmas Eve, until the final whistle on a narrow Patriots victory.<\/p>\n<p>In business, Redstone was relentless. During a fierce bidding war for Paramount, he decided to sue America\u2019s reigning cable-system titan, who was then backing a rival bid. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sue John Malone,\u201d MTV Networks chief Tom Freston, one of his top deputies, advised Redstone. \u201cHe\u2019s our biggest distributor.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/family-tree-1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649489\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/family-tree-1.png?w=370&#038;h=420\" alt=\"family-tree (1)\" width=\"370\" height=\"420\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Redstone stood up, walked over to Freston, and bellowed at him: \u201cNobody shits in my mouth!\u201d Viacom sued Malone\u2019s company (claiming antitrust violations), Malone retreated, and Redstone won Paramount.<\/p>\n<p>Christine Peters, a Hollywood producer and onetime Redstone flame, recalls sitting down for dinner at a restaurant in Hawaii with her daughters and the mogul, then about 80, when his steak arrived overdone. Redstone summoned the chef to their table, stuck his fork in the meat, and flung it at him. \u201cWhy are you so mean to people?\u201d she recalls asking him. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Redstone replied. \u201cI&#8217;m going to hell anyway.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-46\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"46\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps that was his destiny from the start. In a 2004 deposition, Sumner\u2019s younger brother Edward, then 76, commented on life as a Redstone: \u201cMy family, basically, it was a dysfunctional family. It really was. And still is.\u201d Their mother Belle, according to Eddie, was \u201ca crazy tyrant.\u201d Father Mickey was \u201cmean and tough.\u201d And his brother? \u201cSumner controlled my father until almost the very end.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15%;width:60%;padding-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-1758187.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647954\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-1758187.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1535\" alt=\"&quot;How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days&quot; New York Screening\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1535\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Producer Christine Peters at a 2003 movie premiere.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Evan Agostini\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p>Redstones have been battling one another in court for nearly a half-century. Most of it focused on whether Sumner had swindled his relatives in winning control of the family\u2019s movie-theater business, called National Amusements. Eddie sued his brother, Sumner, and father, Mickey. Brent Redstone, Sumner\u2019s son, accused his father and sister Shari of self-dealing and misappropriating millions of dollars. Nephew Michael (Eddie\u2019s son) sued his dad and uncle Sumner.<\/p>\n<p>The bitterness transcended the courtroom. Sumner and his son Brent haven\u2019t spoken in a decade. Eddie died in 2011; Sumner didn\u2019t attend his brother\u2019s funeral. And the conflict has now extended into a fourth generation: Brent\u2019s daughter Keryn has sided with Manuela Herzer, battling against Shari Redstone and her children.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the contentiousness shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise: Mickey, the family patriarch, who operated Boston nightclubs he\u2019d started with money from an infamous local mobster, kept a set of brass knuckles in his desk. In 1936 he launched what became National Amusements, then a small chain of drive-ins. This closely held private company would serve as the battleground for the family warfare\u2014and the vehicle for Sumner\u2019s audacious billion-dollar deals. National Amusements holds Redstone\u2019s controlling stakes in Viacom and CBS today.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Boston in 1923, Sumner Redstone was preternaturally smart and ruthlessly ambitious, a workaholic bent on winning every fight. Even as he excelled in his studies, driven by a pitiless mother, he remained a discontented outsider. \u201cI had no social life. I had no friends,\u201d Redstone wrote of his high school years in his autobiography.<\/p>\n<p>His college years at Harvard, it seems, were similarly barren. Redstone \u201cprobably had an unhappy and rather lonely time at the college,\u201d noted a memo prepared for a 1983 Harvard fundraising drive, based on information from a classics professor who knew Redstone. \u201cHe probably still harbors some feelings of insecurity and resentment against Harvard \u2018snobs.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 1954, Redstone abandoned a lucrative corporate tax-law practice to join National Amusements. That\u2019s when the family trouble began. Sumner soon became his father\u2019s heir apparent, squeezing out Eddie, who had gone to work there two years earlier after graduating from Harvard Business School.<\/p>\n<p>Eddie grew increasingly bitter about how his father and brother were treating him and finally quit in 1971. Threatening to sell his 40% stake to an outsider, he sued Sumner and their father, prompting his mother to tell Eddie that he had \u201cbrought disgrace on you, our family and all of us.\u201d Eddie wrote back, \u201cUnder all the laws of God, there is no justification for Sumner\u2019s and Dad\u2019s activities\u2026.The immorality\u2026.is almost beyond belief.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/companions-tree-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649599\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/companions-tree-2.png?w=370&#038;h=530\" alt=\"companions-tree (2)\" width=\"370\" height=\"530\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>The dispute was settled, like most Redstone problems, with cash. Eddie received $5 million (and went on to become a successful banker); Sumner gained control of National Amusements, partly through a provision placing him in charge of trusts holding shares for his and Eddie\u2019s children. In a noteworthy bit of self-dealing that would come under attack in future family litigation, Sumner later had National Amusements purchase most of these shares from the trusts for $21.4 million, boosting his personal stake to 67%. Sumner\u2019s children, Shari and Brent, held the remaining 33%.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-47\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"47\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>National Amusements thrived under Sumner, replacing drive-ins with upscale indoor \u201cmultiplex cinemas\u201d (a term it trademarked), eventually growing to more than 1,000 screens across the country and overseas.<\/p>\n<p>Within the industry, Redstone made his mark with litigation that no one else would have dared: He sued the Hollywood studios (his industry\u2019s supplier) to end their practice of making theaters bid to book films sight unseen. Litigation was a treasured business weapon. As he put it decades after leaving the legal profession, \u201cI practice law every day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nothing seemed to slow Sumner. He famously survived a 1979 fire at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston that severely burned half his body, requiring months of excruciating skin grafts and transforming his right hand into a purplish claw that he\u2019d gnaw on when lost in thought. (He later resumed playing tennis by strapping a racquet onto his arm.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-514870696.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647951\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-514870696.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Firemen On Ladder At Flame-Engulfed Wind\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">The 1979 fire at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Bettmann\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With firm control of the family business, Redstone in the 1980s began using National Amusements to make ever-larger investments in publicly traded entertainment companies. But he remained little known outside of the Boston business community.<\/p>\n<p>That changed in 1987, with his $3.4-billion victory in a bidding war for Viacom, then an underperforming media conglomerate that had acquired its most promising assets\u2014MTV, Nickelodeon, and Showtime\u2014just two years earlier. Overnight, Redstone became a man who mattered to Wall Street, Hollywood, and gossip columnists\u2014at the age of 64.<\/p>\n<p>Other improbable deals followed. Viacom snatched up Paramount for $10 billion in 1994 and CBS in 2000, besting moguls like Barry Diller in frenzied bidding wars. Wall Street wisdom held that Redstone routinely overpaid in his obsession to win each new prize. He wanted desperately to overtake Time Warner, and make Viacom the biggest media company on the planet (a goal he never achieved).<\/p>\n<p>Despite Wall Street\u2019s skepticism, Redstone\u2019s acquisitions paid off. Viacom\u2014driven by fast growth at MTV and Nickelodeon and syndication profits (it bought distribution rights to <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>)\u2014became a cash machine. Focused on younger viewers, its basic-cable programming, including hits like <em>South Park<\/em> and <em>SpongeBob Squarepants<\/em>, drew ever-higher ratings, boosting ad sales and distribution. In 2000, Redstone\u2019s personal net worth peaked, by a <em>Forbes<\/em> estimate, at $14 billion (it\u2019s now about $5.2 billion).<\/p>\n<p>In the early years, Redstone left his operating executives alone. Waking at 4 a.m., he began his day by studying the overnight grosses for his movie theaters. Arriving at the office, he obsessed over just a few things: the gyrations of Viacom\u2019s stock, key strategic moves (especially lawsuits), and the next transaction. Recalls Frank Biondi, who Redstone hired as CEO after buying Viacom: \u201cSumner said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know the day-to-day businesses. All I want to do is be involved in the deals. When we do deals, bring them to me\u2014I\u2019m good at it.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Redstone reveled in his late-life stature as a mogul. He loved appearing on magazine covers and in gossip columns. He carefully monitored his standing on Hollywood power lists. In 2001, Simon &amp; Schuster, a Viacom subsidiary, published and heavily promoted Redstone\u2019s memoir, <em>A Passion to Win<\/em>, in which he airbrushed his messy personal history, writing of his \u201cintimate, loving relationship\u201d with family.<\/p>\n<p>Though Viacom was publicly traded and governed by a board of directors, Redstone, through National Amusements, owned most of its Class A voting shares, making it subject to his every whim. It was a fact he never let anyone forget. \u201cViacom is me. I\u2019m Viacom,\u201d he gleefully <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/1999\/04\/26\/sumner-redstone-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\">declared to <em>Fortune<\/em> in 1999<\/a>. \u201cThat marriage is eternal, forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other bonds were not. Redstone\u2019s wife, Phyllis, who he\u2019d wed in 1947, had raised their two children, Shari and Brent, in Newton, a Boston suburb. But at least since the 1970s, Sumner had openly carried on an affair with Delsa Weiner, a doctor\u2019s wife and mother of four who lived down the street. (Weiner, who divorced her husband in 1977, later became a writer and changed her name to Winer.)<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15%;width:60%;padding-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5133097a.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648727\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5133097a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1479\" alt=\"'Good Burger' Premiere\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1479\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone and wife, Phyllis, in Los Angeles, 1997.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by BEI\/REX\/Shutterstock<\/span><\/div>\n<p>In fact\u2014though Redstone never mentioned this detail in his frequent recountings of the Copley Square hotel fire \u2014Winer was in his suite with him that night, escaping with far less severe burns. In 1988 (as a <em>Boston <\/em>magazine article first reported), a trust administered by Redstone\u2019s personal attorney bought her a four-bedroom home in Lincoln, Mass., on a wooded 17-acre tract, for $1.75 million. A subsequent mortgage amendment listed Redstone as the co-borrower and stated that he was living there.<\/p>\n<p>This was just one element of the awkwardness that Redstone\u2019s odd personal life has always posed for his family\u2014and for Viacom. Winer at times accompanied Redstone at corporate events, including a business trip on the Viacom jet to Thailand, where the couple spent one evening visiting sex clubs. He introduced his mistress to a Viacom executive as \u201can old friend and a poet.\u201d When Winer died in 2013, at age 86, her children identified her in an obituary as a \u201cdear friend of Sumner Redstone for many years,\u201d and included a snapshot of the two together among the family photos.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this, Phyllis and Sumner\u2014known for bickering nonstop on cross-country flights\u2014clung for a half-century to a marriage that Sumner later said was \u201crocky from day one.\u201d They sued one another for divorce three times (Phyllis twice, Sumner once). Each time, they somehow patched things up.<\/p>\n<p>Then in 1997, Redstone became smitten with Christine Peters, a striking 44-year-old divorced Paramount producer. Peters was a business partner with Redstone\u2019s old friend Bob Evans, the Hollywood raconteur and ladies man who helped launch the <em>Godfather<\/em> films and <em>Chinatown<\/em>. Redstone vacationed with Peters in Sardinia and Hawaii and began staying at her Bel Air estate during his frequent business trips to Los Angeles. Redstone arranged for his most trusted Viacom lieutenants, Philippe Dauman and Tom Dooley, to fly out to L.A. from New York for dinner at Peters\u2019s home, so they could assess her and offer Redstone their views on the relationship. (In later years, he came to care less about his subordinates\u2019 view of his female companions.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-48\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"48\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In May 1999, Redstone flew to Paris to join Peters, who was touring the city with her mother and two daughters. There, a private detective hired by Phyllis photographed Redstone and Peters strolling hand-in-hand. Phyllis\u2019 lawyers provided the photo to the <em>New York Post<\/em>, along with the news that she was suing Sumner for divorce yet again\u2014and meant it this time. With the filing, and leaked warnings that Phyllis wanted half of his then-$6 billion fortune, Wall Street feared the split would imperil the mammoth CBS acquisition, then underway. Redstone rushed to assure everyone: \u201cNothing that takes place in my personal life will have anything to do with the management and control of Viacom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The truth was just the opposite: Redstone\u2019s personal life would determine the control of Viacom, both then and more than a decade into the future. If Phyllis got half her husband\u2019s two-thirds stake in National Amusements, Shari and Brent (who each owned one-sixth) could align with their mother to control the business. Sumner began maneuvering to eliminate that possibility.<\/p>\n<p>By then, Brent was 50 and living on a ranch outside Colorado. He\u2019d moved there after 14 years as a prosecutor in Boston, followed by a short, unhappy stint working for his father at Viacom. Also a lawyer, Shari, then 46, had abandoned other career plans to help her father run the Boston-based theater business. She became president of National Amusements in January 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Both Brent and Shari served on the Sumner-friendly boards of National Amusements and Viacom, where they helped set their father\u2019s pay as members of the compensation committee. Redstone, rough on everyone around him, was particularly brutal on his offspring. Still, Brent would later contend, he\u2019d assured them they\u2019d take over the business someday.<\/p>\n<p>With a divorce settlement under discussion with Phyllis, Sumner began pressuring his children to give him voting control over their stakes in National Amusements. After Shari agreed but Brent refused, their father began treating Shari \u201cwith extreme favoritism,\u201d while freezing him out of the business and ousting him from the Viacom board, Brent would later claim.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, Sumner struck a deal with his wife and daughter to assure his grip on the empire, while setting the stage for Shari\u2019s rise. The Redstones\u2019 divorce agreement gave Phyllis half of all distributions from his 80% stake in National Amusements during her lifetime, while allowing him to retain voting control over of all his shares in the holding company\u2014and thus Viacom. Sumner also signed an agreement to let Shari succeed him as nonexecutive chair of his companies. Sumner&#8217;s shares were placed in an irrevocable trust to benefit their five grandchildren. Once he died or became incapacitated, the trust\u2014governed by seven trustees, including Shari and one of her sons\u2014would take control of his shares.<\/p>\n<p>In the settlement\u2019s aftermath, Sumner publicly promoted his daughter to the media as his likely successor, calling her \u201ca great businesswoman\u201d with \u201cno major weakness.\u201d He named her nonexecutive vice-chair of Viacom in June 2005. A <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em> profile portrayed her as \u201ca magnate-in-waiting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In February 2006, Brent sued National Amusements, saying he\u2019d been frozen out for defying his father\u2019s \u201cnaked attempt\u201d to gain \u201ccomplete control.\u201d He accused Sumner\u2014and his sister\u2014of misappropriating millions in National Amusements assets for their personal benefit, including transferring a multimillion-dollar suite at the Pierre Hotel to Phyllis as a \u201cpayoff\u201d in Sumner\u2019s divorce. (Viacom says Sumner paid for it.) Brent demanded a breakup of the business, citing \u201cthe oppressive acts of those in control.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The suit was settled a year later, with a reported $240-million buyout for Brent\u2019s shares, boosting Sumner\u2019s voting stake in National Amusements to 80%. (Shari has the rest.) In the battle\u2019s aftermath, Sumner stopped speaking to his son. Inside Viacom, recalls one executive, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to talk about Brent. He didn\u2019t exist.\u201d Asked later why he\u2019d moved to Denver, Brent replied: \u201cBecause there were no direct flights from Boston.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With his control assured, Sumner, who seemed constitutionally incapable of sticking with any plan that envisioned his departure (much less his demise), retreated from his commitment to Shari. Father and daughter had suffered from a contentious personal relationship for decades. Back in 1984, he\u2019d complained bitterly in a letter about her \u201clack of regard\u201d and \u201cdisdain\u201d for him. \u201cThey were like oil and water,\u201d says one longtime Redstone colleague. \u201cHe never gave her anything unless he needed to do it. Everything came out of some fight, some threatened lawsuit. It\u2019s a family history that\u2019s more about horse trading than affection.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now in business together, they battled over matters large and small, especially the prospects for the movie-theater company, which she continued to run. She wanted to spend heavily to expand internationally; he wanted to sell it. One executive who knew her described Shari as \u201cSumner in a skirt,\u201d but Redstone had concluded she wasn\u2019t fit to fill his shoes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-49\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"49\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>He began belittling his daughter\u2019s business acumen in public\u2014and disparaged her more harshly in private. In 2007, Redstone dispatched a dismissive letter about Shari to <em>Forbes<\/em>: \u201cIt must be remembered that I gave to my children their stock; and it is I, with little or no contribution on their part, who built these great media companies\u2026.\u201d On multiple occasions, according to witnesses, Redstone called his daughter a \u201cc&#8211;t\u201d\u2014in at least one case, at a Viacom board meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Redstone had signed an agreement providing that Shari would succeed him\u2014and publicly noted that his anointed directors had \u201cnever gone against my wishes.\u201d Yet in 2007, he began taking a dramatically different position. He now insisted the question was out of his hands, that good corporate governance demanded the directors pick his successor. If that wasn\u2019t satisfactory, he said he would consider buying out his daughter\u2019s 20% interest in National Amusements\u2014for the right price. Shari hired a lawyer, and pondered pursuing the course of so many previous Redstones: suing Sumner.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>By then, Redstone had already abruptly fired three highly regarded potential successors. In 1996, he canned Viacom CEO Biondi, who had overseen the company\u2019s growth from $1 billion to $12 billion in revenues. Biondi says Redstone told him he now knew the business well enough to run it himself. Redstone also grumbled that Biondi, who took regular family vacations and rarely dined with him, didn\u2019t work hard enough.<\/p>\n<p>Already executive chairman, Redstone took the CEO title for himself for the next nine years. In 2000, upon merging with CBS, he named its hard-nosed chief, Mel Karmazin, as Viacom\u2019s COO. Redstone publicly insisted they could co-exist, and proclaimed him his likely successor. Biondi says he warned Karmazin that if he was taking the job on the assumption that he could outlast the much older Redstone, \u201cyou\u2019re in for a rude awakening.\u201d Four years later, after the stock dropped, Karmazin (whom Redstone had taken to calling \u201cKarma-fuck\u201d) was gone.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5135244a.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648732\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5135244a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=760\" alt=\"'Star Trek' The Experience\" width=\"1024\" height=\"760\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone with wife and three of their grandchildren, Las Vegas 1998.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by BEI\/REX\/Shutterstock<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Redstone next decided to split Viacom and CBS into separate companies, just five years after combining them. He named Freston, the widely admired chief of MTV Networks\u2014he\u2019d helped launch the business in 1981\u2014as Viacom\u2019s CEO (and his latest presumptive heir). Leslie Moonves became CEO of CBS.<\/p>\n<p>The maneuver was a stock play, driven by Redstone\u2019s belief that CBS would appeal to value investors, while Viacom, then far larger, would appeal to the growth crowd. (Analysts dubbed them \u201cVia-Slow\u201d and \u201cVia-Grow.\u201d) But amid a declining market, Viacom\u2019s shares continued to slide, while CBS prospered. Redstone fired Freston in September 2006, just eight months into his tenure, citing his unhappiness about the stock and the company\u2019s failure to make a big Internet acquisition, after archrival Rupert Murdoch outbid Viacom for MySpace.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe worst part was that Rupert was being [hailed] as some great old-media guy who reinvented himself, and Sumner was not,\u201d recalls Freston. \u201cIt was like a stone in his shoe.\u201d Redstone later told an interviewer the loss to Murdoch was \u201chumiliating.\u201d (The MySpace acquisition turned out to be a disaster.) When Freston, who had been at MTV for 25 years, returned to clean out his office, some 2,500 employees mobbed the lobby of Viacom\u2019s Times Square headquarters, shouting his name, to say farewell.<\/p>\n<p>Re-enter Redstone\u2019s closest business confidant: Philippe Pierre Dauman. The two men had met at the outset of the battle for Viacom, when Dauman was a 32-year-old corporate-law associate at Shearman &amp; Sterling. He\u2019d served as Redstone\u2019s <em>consigliere<\/em> ever since. For his part, Redstone seemed to show more fatherly affection toward Dauman than he did to his actual children.<\/p>\n<p>Dauman joined the Viacom board after the takeover, then became general counsel in 1993. Redstone also named him a director of National Amusements and co-executor of his estate. In 1999, Dauman departed to make room for Karmazin, though he remained a Viacom director and received a $34-million exit package. Dauman launched a private equity firm with executive vice president Tom Dooley, another Redstone intimate who departed. But with Freston\u2019s September 2006 dismissal, both immediately returned\u2014with Dauman as CEO. (Dooley is now chief operating officer.)<\/p>\n<p>Dauman, a natty dresser, is whip smart: He scored a perfect 1600 on his SATs\u2014at age 13\u2014and later complained of being bored with his studies at Yale, after entering the university at 16. Yet from his start as CEO, he came under attack as a creatively challenged suit, miscast atop a youth-focused content company. The hip, culture-savvy Freston declared nothing out of bounds at Viacom \u201cexcept frontal nudity.\u201d When Dauman, during a management offsite a year after taking over, presented a list of 10 &#8220;organizing principles&#8221; that included &#8220;civility,&#8221; everyone snickered.<\/p>\n<p>Dauman defined his early tenure with a Redstone-esque move\u2014filing a $1 billion lawsuit in March 2007 against YouTube and its parent, Google, charging \u201cbrazen\u201d copyright infringement. Dauman wanted Viacom to be paid for the clips YouTube regularly posted without permission from popular Viacom programs, such as Jon Stewart\u2019s <em>Daily Show<\/em>, <em>South Park<\/em>, and <em>SpongeBob Squarepants<\/em>. At one point, Google offered $900 million for rights to Viacom clips. But Dauman rejected the deal (a spokesperson asserts the money wasn&#8217;t guaranteed and the terms were &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;). In the meantime, as Dauman demanded, YouTube removed all traces of Viacom programming, depriving its shows of a hot new platform for marketing to young viewers. A federal judge twice threw the case out on summary judgment, and after seven years and millions in legal fees, Viacom ended up with nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Despite his background as an M&amp;A lawyer, Dauman made few moves to broaden Viacom\u2019s meager digital footprint\u2014a failure that would come to plague the company. Instead, he focused on boosting Viacom\u2019s shares through another gambit out of the Redstone playbook: a massive stock-buyback program. By mid-2007, Viacom shares were up 23%. \u201cI don\u2019t think you ask for anything more,\u201d Redstone told a reporter.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>For all his irascibility, Redstone seemed desperate for the constant companionship\u2014and adoration\u2014of the opposite sex. Even before his messy divorce from Phyllis became final in July 2002, he had proposed marriage to three different women.<\/p>\n<p>One of them was Peters, whose Paris rendezvous with Redstone had been the flashpoint for his divorce. Peters\u2019s unwillingness to marry Redstone\u2014she thought he was too old and didn\u2019t care enough about her career or family\u2014infuriated the billionaire. In October 2000, he faxed her an angry, intensely personal letter he\u2019d dictated to his secretary. \u201cYou ruined my life twice,\u201d Redstone wrote. \u201cYou ruined the life that I had before you\u2014not your fault\u2014but you ruined it. You ruined the second life that I had with you\u2026..I rue the day I ever met you\u2026.I hate you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even in his vitriolic letter to his lover, Redstone couldn\u2019t stop himself from talking business. He ranted about Karmazin, then his CBS merger partner. Publicly, Redstone had avowed his respect for Karmazin and declared him his heir apparent. To Peters, Redstone wrote that Karmazin had \u201cinsulted\u201d and \u201cabused\u201d him, by refusing to show proper deference. \u201cWhy go on? I will get rid of him in 2 \u00bd years. [Karmazin would be gone in four.] I will get rid of you now\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A week later, a calmer Redstone wrote her again to pledge his friendship, while lamenting her priorities. \u201cSomeday, perhaps, you will realize there is more to life than your children and your career and that if there is a man in your life who is important to you, you will protect and defend him\u2014maybe exalt him\u2014but never diminish him\u2026..\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In April 2003, months after his divorce from Phyllis was final, Redstone, then 79, married Paula Fortunato, a 40-year-old New York City elementary school teacher from New Jersey. His stockbroker had set them up. Their lavish wedding reception was held at the New York Public Library, where Tony Bennett sang. (He\u2019d been friendly with Redstone ever since MTV helped resurrect his career.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtrlgdq.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647963\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtrlgdq.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"SUMNER REDSTONE AND PAULA FORTUNATO LEAVE NEW YORK TEMPLE AFTERWEDDING.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone and Paula Fortunato on their wedding day in 2003.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Chip East\u2014Reuters<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPaula\u2019s a nice girl,\u201d one Viacom executive in attendance recalls Redstone telling his guests. \u201cNot the most beautiful girl. But she knows I love Viacom first and foremost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Redstone relocated with his new bride to Los Angeles, where he\u2019d bought a $14.5-million mansion in Beverly Park, a gated celebrity enclave whose residents include Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart, and Denzel Washington. Redstone\u2019s 15,355-square-foot home featured five bedrooms, eight baths, indoor and outdoor pools, a tennis court, and fountains. Inside his hilltop enclave, Redstone ran his empire by phone from a lounge chair in his study, lined with giant tanks containing saltwater fish, which fascinated him. (He boasted of owning the world\u2019s largest private collection.)<\/p>\n<p>The marriage seemed to begin well, with friendly media profiles declaring that Redstone had finally achieved domestic bliss. Paula called him \u201cPuppy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But life with Redstone soon turned into screaming fights. Christine Peters, who remained friends with Redstone long after their romantic relationship ended, recalls that he periodically would seek refuge on daytime outings, calling to suggest they \u201cgo fishing.\u201d He would meet her for lunch at the Bel Air Hotel in Beverly Hills, then have his driver take them to visit the latest arrivals at the exotic-fish wholesalers he patronized in the San Fernando Valley.<\/p>\n<p>In October 2008, Redstone announced his divorce. A prenuptial agreement reportedly limited Paula\u2019s settlement to $1 million for each year of marriage, but Redstone was more generous than required. In late 2008, he bought her a $4-million home in Beverly Hills and a $2.6-million condominium in Florida. For years to come, he would have his driver deliver dinner to Fortunato\u2019s home every night.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 85, Sumner Redstone was back on the dating scene.<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<ul style=\"display:inline-block;height:100%;margin-bottom:35px;padding:0 10px;line-height:1em;list-style-type:none;\">\n<li style=\"display:block;float:left;height:100%;font-size:.875em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;margin:10px 0 0;padding:0 10px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-2\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read Part II here.<\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"display:block;float:left;height:100%;font-size:.875em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;margin:10px 0 0;padding:0 10px;border-left:3px solid;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-3\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read Part III here.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 5, 2016","published":"2016-05-05 04:34:24","updated":"2016-05-05 04:34:24","minute":"4:34 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/h_8-00050075.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Redstone in 2001, Photograph by Timothy Allen \u2014 eyevine\/Redux","caption":"Sumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom, 2001","attach_id":"1648703"},"excerpt":"<p>A lurid trial centering on the billionaire\u2019s capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1645944","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/peter-elkind-with-marty-jones\/","name":"Peter Elkind with Marty Jones","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"A lurid trial centering on the billionaire\u2019s capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","seo":{"seo_title":"The Disturbing Decline of CBS and Viacom's Sumner Redstone","seo_description":"A lurid trial centering on the Sumner Redstone's capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","seo_keywords":"sumner redstone, sumner redstone trial, viacom, cbs, Philippe Dauman, manuela herzer, sydney holland, shari redstone, les moonves, pierce o\u2019donnell","seo_news_keywords":"sumner redstone, sumner redstone trial, viacom, cbs, Philippe Dauman, manuela herzer, sydney holland, shari redstone, les moonves, pierce o\u2019donnell","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2Fsumner-redstone-part-1%2F","shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1pYoASI","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1pYoASI","encoded_title":"The+Disturbing+Decline+of+Sumner+Redstone+%28Part+1+of+3%29","twitter_text":"The Disturbing Decline of Sumner Redstone (Part 1 of 3)","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"A lurid trial centering on the Sumner Redstone's capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","facebook_title":"The Disturbing Decline of CBS and Viacom's Sumner Redstone"}},{"id":1651871,"content_type":"free full","is_magazine_content":"non-magazine","url":"\/2016\/05\/09\/lendingclub-renaud-laplanche-severance\/","title":"LendingClub's Ousted CEO Won't Get Any Severance","content":"<p>Renaud Laplanche is out as chairman and CEO of LendingClub <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"LC\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/lc\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">LC<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, the online lending platform he founded 10 years ago, and he didn&#8217;t get any going-away money.<\/p>\n<p>Laplanche on Friday resigned as chairman and CEO of LendingClub, following an internal investigation that found that several managers at the San Francisco-based company had knowingly violated company rules by selling $22 million in near-prime loans\u2015$15 million in March, $7 million in April\u2015to a single institutional investor in violation of some of that investor&#8217;s instructions (the company is not going into further detail).

That was the theme of John F. Kennedy\u2019s <em>Profiles in Courage<\/em>, and many historians have made the same point. For a reminder of how following the populace rather than leading it can be disastrous, turn your attention to the Philippines, where the polls in the presidential election closed not long ago. As I write, Rodrigo Duterte is reported to be well ahead with two-thirds of the votes counted, and if you haven\u2019t been following this race, you won\u2019t believe how he has become the likely victor.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that the Philippines have been a democracy since 1986, when Corazon Aquino, mother of current President Benigno Aquino III, was elected president. By law, he can\u2019t run for re-election, and he urged the other candidates to unite against Duterte, but they refused; Duterte needs only a plurality to win. At his campaign rallies, which in some cases attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters, he essentially promised to end democracy \u2013 to declare \u201ca revolutionary government\u201d \u2013 if congress thwarts his will. He bragged about overseeing the killing of hundreds of alleged criminals, without trials, as mayor of the the city of Davao, and he promised to kill thousands more \u2013 to \u201cfill Manila Bay with their bodies\u201d \u2013 to impose order if elected president.<\/p>\n<p>In his heavily Catholic country he called Pope Francis \u201cthe son of a whore,\u201d and he routinely dismisses critics in language you will not read on Fortune.com. He made a joke about an Australian nun who was raped and killed in the Philippines; when the ambassadors of Australia and the U.S. objected, he told them to \u201cshut up.\u201d He angrily denied media reports that he had a secret bank account filled with wealth from payoffs until a journalist proved its existence by making a deposit. He then admitted it, shrugged, and made a joke.<\/p>\n<p>His followers love all of it. The more he insults everyone in power and promises to blow up the system, the more popular he becomes. The Philippine economy has been growing smartly, but millions of Filipinos remain grindingly poor, and rampant crime makes their lives miserable. They\u2019re desperate for a candidate who talks like them and promises the magic of a sudden solution to their problems, and never mind the niceties of how he\u2019d do it. His supporters are not a majority of Filipinos; polls show that they\u2019re only about 30% of the voting public. But under the rules, that may be enough.<\/p>\n<p>Duterte gave them exactly what they wanted, and he is probably the Philippines\u2019 next president. But his tough-talking campaign strategy was the opposite of courage. It\u2019s often said that bullies are the biggest cowards, and he\u2019s a stellar example.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 12:14:02","updated":"2016-05-09

Unicorns","content":"<p>Hedge funder Christopher Hansen&#8217;s Valiant Capital Management has gotten a big boost from its lineage. Hansen is an alumni of a hedge fund of someone who was once worked for Tiger Fund Management&#8217;s Julian Robertson\u2014earning Valiant the nickname inside the industry, like a number of other firms, of Tiger Cub, though Valiant is technically a grandcub. But it&#8217;s another animal, itself legendary, that could be his undoing\u2014the unicorn.<\/p>\n<p>About one-quarter of the fund is invested in private companies, including seven so-called tech unicorns\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/unicorns\/\">companies valued at over $1 billion<\/a>. The unicorns had helped propel the San Francisco-based Valiant\u2019s returns in recent years, but this year have landed the fund in the red, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/11\/11\/snapchat-fidelity-valuation\/\">as a number of blow-ups have caused investors to grow more cautious about the richly valued start-ups.<\/a> Valiant told investors last month that its main fund is down slightly under 10% through April, according to an individual familiar with the performance. Write-downs on its big portfolio of private investments appear to be a major factor, according to investor documents <em>Fortune<\/em> has obtained.<\/p>\n<p>But a thorough analysts of Valiant&#8217;s documents seems to show that Hansen&#8217;s fund may actually be down more than he is letting on. According to the documents, Valiant appears to have failed to fully write down the value of a number of his unicorn holdings. As a result, the fund is valuing those holdings at inflated prices, at least compared with where other similar fund say those investments are now worth. That likely means Valiant performance, even its poor performance, is inflated this year as well.<\/p>\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned with how funds are marking their holdings of the highly valued tech start-ups and whether they may be deceiving their investors. Last last year, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/11\/18\/mutual-funds-unicorns\/\">the SEC began investigating mutual funds<\/a> to audit their procedures for valuing the private holdings. In a March speech at Stanford Law School, SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White said that it was committed to protecting investors in the so-called unicorns no matter how sophisticated or high net worth they are. Hedge funds typically cater to high net worth individuals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"28\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4562575247001-28\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4562575247001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1VLOwyO\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daarontask%2Cdanielroberts%2Cfortunelive%2Cjackdorseyipo%2Cjackdorseysquare%2Cjackdorseysquareipo%2Cjackdorseytwitter%2Cleighgallagher%2Csquare%2Csquaregoespublic%2Csquareipo%2Csquaretoraise275million%2Cstephengandel%2Ctechstartups%2Ctechstartups%2Cunicornsoftech%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dfortunelive&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>\u201cNearly all venture valuations are highly subjective,\u201d White said during the March speech. \u201cThe concern is whether the prestige associated with reaching a sky high valuation fast drives companies to try to appear more valuable than they actually are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hansen, 47, launched Valiant in 2008 after leaving $5 billion Blue Ridge Capital, one of the storied Tiger cub hedge funds run by the notoriously reclusive John Griffin. The Blue Ridge scion began investing in venture capital in 2009 and scored some big hits with Facebook and Alibaba, which he quickly sold out of with 31% gains in each.<\/p>\n<p>Valiant ramped up its venture investing and now has 23 investments, including big names like Dropbox, Evernote, Pinterest, and Uber, according to its investor documents. The investments are held in a separate side pocket, and investor capital is locked in until Valiant exits the privates, via IPOs or other sales. Valiant doesn\u2019t take performance fees on the privates until that time either.<\/p>\n<p>A big drop in the value of the private tech companies would hurt Valiant more than other hedge funds as it is believed to have more in privates than most of its peers. At leading tech-oriented Tiger Global, for example, privates account for less than 8% of the firm\u2019s $8 billion hedge fund, as it invests in startups in separate private equity funds. Tiger Global was down 21% through March, but only about 10% of the losses are attributable to write downs of its private investments, according to an individual familiar with the fund\u2019s results.<\/p>\n<p>Even by its own numbers, Valiant is having a bad year. The stock market is basically flat for the year. But if Valiant was marking it holdings where other funds are, its performance would be even worse.<\/p>\n<p>Take Dropbox one of the most troubled of Valiant\u2019s big VC holdings. Last year, mutual funds Fidelity and T. Rowe Price began writing down their holdings of Dropbox, which has been struggling to justify its $10 billion valuation. As of the end of 2015, Valiant said it valued its Dropbox stake at $50.4 million, or $18 per share, according to calculations from investor documents.<\/p>\n<p>Others weren\u2019t so charitable. By end of last year, Fidelity had written down Dropbox to $13.50 per share and T. Rowe Price had slashed it to $9.40, nearly down to where Valiant\u2019s purchased the shares at $9.05. If Valiant had valued its Dropbox stake where T. Rowe Price did, the fund would have had an additional $24 million is losses on that stock alone.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDropbox has greatly exceeded all of Valiant\u2019s expectations and guidance to date,\u201d Hansen wrote in an investor presentation at the time, though he added that the company has \u201cslightly underperformed on the enterprise side.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Evernote, a cloud-based note taking and storage app that Valiant said was worth $1.4 billion at year-end, is in even worse shape than Dropbox. Last year, Business Insider wrote a story <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10\">about the companies &#8220;deep troubles.&#8221;<\/a> Valiant invested in several financing rounds of Evernote, and at the end of December it valued Evernote at $12.56 per share, which was a little above break-even for the hedge fund, documents show. Even so, it may have been too optimistic: T.Rowe Price marked Evernote down to $7.66 at year-end.<\/p>\n<p>While others in the industry are questioning Evernote\u2019s future, Valiant claims that \u201cthe company is cementing its leadership position in the space\u201d with 1 million new users each month.<\/p>\n<p>Valiant declined to comment for this article.<\/p>\n<p>It could very well be that the fund has adjusted the value of those holdings and others this year. But according to a source, Valiant had only cut the value of its overall private portfolio by 10%. But you would have expected that group on investments to have tumbled more. T. Rowe, for instance, further cut its price of Dropbox to $7.91 at the end of March, <a href=\"http:\/\/graphics.wsj.com\/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch\/\">according to the <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>.<\/a> By that measure, Valiant&#8217;s investment in the storage company has plunged 56% from where it marked it at the end of last year.<\/p>\n<p>Its Evernote stake, appears to have tumbled as well. T. Rowe now values that company at $6.04, a 52% below where Valiant had valued the stake at the end of 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Valiant uses third-party valuation agent Duff &amp; Phelps to help determine the marks, which it makes quarterly.<\/p>\n<p>Since Valiant is not collecting performance fees on the private states until the companies are sold or go public, Valiant may argue that it doesn&#8217;t matter where it values the stakes now as long as it gets them right at the IPO or sale. But that&#8217;s not correct. Since the value works into the overall performance of the funds, inflated values can cause the fund to look like it is doing better than it is, giving Hansen the ability to raise more funds, which it has recently started doing. The hedge fund, which told investors it wants to keep assets near $2.5 billion, opened the door this year to new money, hoping to offset redemptions, according to a February Reuters report.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, while Valiant isn&#8217;t collecting performance fee on the private investments, it is collecting its 2% management fee on the value of all the assets in his fund. Inflated valuations of those unicorns will boost what Valiant collects from its management fee.<\/p>\n<p>Valiant still has big gains in Uber and Pinterest, valued at $64 billion and $11 billion respectively. Although Pinterest has been mentioned as a 2016 IPO candidate, Valiant seems to have slightly cooled on the social media company, writing it down 3% during the fourth quarter to $6.97 per share.

Miller faced in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>The headlines were everywhere: Charles Cullen, a nurse at Somerset Medical Center in New Jersey, had been charged with murdering one patient and attempting to kill another by administering lethal combinations of drugs. The so-called \u201cAngel of Death,\u201d who confessed to killing as many as 40 patients over the course of his 16-year nursing career, would eventually receive multiple consecutive life sentences.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of Cullen\u2019s employment at Somerset Medical, Miller was the hospital\u2019s chief executive. Months before Cullen\u2019s murderous activity was splashed across headlines, the hospital conducted its own internal investigation following two unexplained medical incidents in the ICU (one patient survived, the other died). But it failed to bring its suspicions to the police. As the story unfolded in public, Miller\u2019s decision not to report the hospital\u2019s concerns about Cullen to law enforcement was placed under increasing scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>Cullen may have been the central villain, but the press portrayed Miller as a silent accomplice. According to report in 60 Minutes, five patients died in the three-month window between the start of Somerset\u2019s internal investigation and Cullen\u2019s arrest.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, Miller says he was simply following the advice of the hospital\u2019s longstanding general counsel: \u201cI\u2019m not passing judgment whether good, bad or indifferent, but the whole thing almost from the get-go was organized by him, not me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Related: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/05\/venture-capital-health-care\/\" target=\"_blank\">Venture Capital Is Facing an Impending Health-Care &#8216;Avalanche&#8217;<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For an angry public, this was a technicality. After Cullen\u2019s arrest in December 2003, Miller did a series of high-profile interviews \u2013 with Katie Couric, Wolf Blitzer, and Morley Safer, among others \u2013 in an attempt to be forthcoming and set the record straight.<\/p>\n<p>Despite his attempt at transparency, Miller sensed he wouldn\u2019t survive the tragedy. After all, Cullen had worked for years, unchecked, under his leadership. \u201cI took this personally. I\u2019m hospital CEO,\u201d he says \u201cPeople died here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In one way he was right. About seven months after Cullen\u2019s arrest, the hospital asked for Miller\u2019s resignation. It was a tortured time. After losing his job, Miller spoke to a headhunter who told him that thanks to his association with Cullen, \u201cyou\u2019ll never get another job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Starting again.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite the tragedy\u2019s unfathomable scale &#8212; investigators would uncover that Cullen killed 13 patients while employed at Somerset Medical &#8212; Miller refused to crumble under its weight.<\/p>\n<p>Today, he coaches, consults, speaks and writes books on leadership and strategy in the nonprofit sector. He\u2019s worked with Franklin Pierce University and Princeton University, but he now mostly consults organizations that focus on behavioral wellness, such as NewBridge Services, New Jersey Association for Mental Health and Addiction Agencies and Montgomery Academy.<\/p>\n<p>When the hospital let him go, Miller\u2019s professional future was one giant question mark. He tentatively began networking, searching for a new path that would provide his days with some much needed structure. Shortly after his dismissal, he had an informal meeting with Robin Albers, the regional vice president for the American Cancer Society in North Jersey. She asked for his advice on how to raise money, build a healthy board and develop a brand within the community.<\/p>\n<p>Miller didn\u2019t know what the next chapter of his life would look like, but these were questions he could answer. In his car after the meeting, a light bulb suddenly went off &#8212; maybe this was his calling. Since 2005, he estimates he\u2019s coached \u201chundreds of nonprofit organizations,\u201d helping them do everything from become more engaged with their communities, build better boards and raise more money.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"29\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4570538677001-29\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4570538677001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1T0McAw\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3D27years%2Cenglishpremierleague%2Cepl%2Csecretsofsuccess%2Csiralexferguson%2Csirmichaelmoritz%2Csoccercoach%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dsiralexferguson&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, Miller did a review for Make-A-Wish New Jersey. Thanks to his advice, which included refining the nonprofit\u2019s message, increasing the size of its board and identifying steps for succession planning, the organization is in a stronger position, says CEO Tom Weatherall. Another client, Xiomara Guevara, executive director of the Morris County Organization for Hispanic Affairs, cites Miller as a driving force behind a community center that helps residents navigate a path to citizenship. Without Dennis\u2019s mentorship, she says, \u201cwe would not have moved forward with the project.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a calling,\u201d Miller says about his work with nonprofits. That\u2019s not to say he wasn\u2019t plagued by financial anxiety &#8212; life without a steady salary took some getting used to &#8212; but it felt good to regain his sense of purpose. As he puts it, \u201cI\u2019m a doer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Finding resilience in a difficult childhood.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To understand how Miller was able to build this new life for himself after Somerset, it\u2019s important to know his exposure to mental illness didn\u2019t start at Somerset Medical. As a boy, Miller was emotionally abused by his father, who he claims suffered from a \u201csevere personality disorder.\u201d Their relationship was so strained that at one point, in an effort to protect his mother, Miller says he tried to kill him with a butter knife. Intensely depressed, at age 20 he checked himself into a psychiatric hospital. It was a turning point in his life. He stopped taking drugs, went on to receive degrees from Rutgers and Columbia University\u2019s School of Public Health, got married and had children. Therapy was a constant throughout.<\/p>\n<p>Following Cullen\u2019s arrest and his subsequent dismissal, however, these childhood demons resurfaced. \u201cOne of my challenges during this [post-Somerset Medical] phase of my life was finally addressing my real issue of self-worth and identity,\u201d he writes in his latest book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Moppin-Floors-CEO-Hopelessness-Happiness\/dp\/1504980026\" target=\"_blank\"><em><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large\">Moppin&#8217; Floors to CEO<\/span><\/em><\/a>. \u201cFor too long my sense of \u2018self\u2019 was based on external factors such as title, income, recognition and what others thought of me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Related: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/03\/leaders-motivate-teams\/\" target=\"_blank\">How the Best Leaders Motivate Their Teams<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Miller believes this painful soul searching ultimately turned him into a more compassionate and effective consultant and leader. His clients often tell him he has an ability to see their future before they do, a \u201cunique skill set\u201d he attributes to \u201cthe tragedy I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The experience also made him acutely aware of the dangers of stigmatizing mental illness in the workplace, which not only injures employees\u2019 well being but also hurts productivity and, by extension, a company\u2019s bottom line. At Somerset, he recalls his own experience being embarrassed when sitting in a therapist\u2019s waiting room. What if someone found out? He was a CEO, after all.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe new thing I\u2019m recommending people do is have a cultural change within the organization. Let\u2019s stop stigmatizing it. Let\u2019s have a discussion about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to talk about it if you\u2019re depressed. Let\u2019s have an open discussion so people feel if they\u2019re overburdened with family life problems that they can go to someone in the company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miller has begun anew and he is bringing a depth to his work that he says is only possible after staring down chilling adversity.<\/p>\n<p>He can\u2019t undo the past. But he says he\u2019s doing his best to create a better future.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 08:45:18","updated":"2016-05-09 08:45:18","minute":"8:45 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/life-after-employing-a-killer\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/life-after-employing-a-killer\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/09\/life-after-employing-a-killer\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"How a CEO Found His Forward After Employing a Serial Killer","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-164792404.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Getty Images","caption":"Charles Cullen, i.e. &quot;the Angel of Death.&quot;","attach_id":"1650288"},"excerpt":"<p>The so-called \u201cAngel of Death\u201d worked under Dennis C.

takeover offer by German conglomerate JAB Holding Company, a sweet 25% premium to the company&#8217;s closing stock price on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>JAB is agreeing to buy Krispy Kreme for $21 per share in cash. The deal for the retailer, which has been a public company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/metlife-krispy-kreme-lead-big-day-for-ipos\">since<\/a> April 2000, is expected to close in the third quarter. As a result of the transaction, Krispy Kreme has postponed an annual shareholders meeting that was originally planned for June.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Tony Thompson lauded the deal, saying JAB&#8217;s &#8220;experience and industry knowledge make them the ideal partner to help grow the iconic Krispy Kreme brand throughout the world.&#8221; After the transaction closes, Krispy Kreme will continue operations at the company&#8217;s current headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C.<\/p>\n<p>The deal for Krispy Kreme <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"kkd\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/kkd\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">kkd<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> is interesting on a few levels.

Sales of the retailer&#8217;s doughnuts comprise of about 89% of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1100270\/000120677416005268\/kkd_10k.htm\">total<\/a> retail sales, with the balance comprised principally of beverage sales.

JAB could help make beverages a greater opportunity for Krispy Kreme.<\/p>\n<p>Krispy Kreme only more recently began to aggressively tackle the potential coffee business. In 2014, it signed deals to sell ready-to-drink coffees in bottles and in 2015, inked a licensing deal to roast and distribute 12-ounce bags of ground coffee.<\/p>\n<p>The German company&#8217;s expertise could also help improve sales abroad. Krispy Kreme, which generates $518.7 million in annual revenue, has posted consistent sales gains in the U.S. market but sales at existing stores in foreign markets have slipped in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Peter Harf, Senior Partner at JAB, said the acquisition was yet &#8220;another example of our commitment to investing in extraordinary brands with significant growth prospects.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 9, 2016","published":"2016-05-09 09:29:42","updated":"2016-05-09 09:29:42","minute":"9:29 AM

Oliver started the segment with an Al Jazeera news segment on Duterte at a recent mass wedding in which the mayor offered himself to the brides as a wedding &#8220;gift&#8221; before making a crass homophobic joke.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; Oliver said on his show. &#8220;Duterte routinely kisses his female supporters, once called the pope \u2018a son of a bitch,\u2019 all of which has earned him a reputation as the \u2018Trump of the East.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Oliver went on to claim that Duterte seems to be &#8220;trying to test the limits on basic human decency,&#8221; noting the mayor&#8217;s pledges to kill more criminals while also calling out Duterte for a recent comment he made in reference to the 1989 rape and murder of an Australian missionary in a Davao jail.

Together, the companies are developing a custom mobile app that ophthalmologists can use to plan and guide cataract extraction surgery\u2014the most common procedure undergone by Medicare beneficiaries. (Up to 30 million Americans will be diagnosed with cataracts by 2020, so that&#8217;s a pretty big &#8220;target audience.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>The app will house electronic medical records as well as clinical data meant to help surgeons select the best replacement lens for an individual patient. The clincher: it will also be \u201ccognitive,\u201d using IBM\u2019s machine learning and Watson analytics resources to collect and analyze data in real time. That means more need for number-crunching, ala IBM cloud services. Testing of the app is set to begin in late 2016, according to the companies.<\/p>\n<p>The SAP-IBM-Apple relationship triangle will make it far simpler for companies to build and expand highly personalized apps of this nature that are iterative\u2014meaning that they can be changed over time as new data, processes, and business models emerge. \u201cThe way it comes together is through advanced analytics mixed with consumer-grade experiences,\u201d van Kralingen said.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 6, 2016","published":"2016-05-06 04:46:48","updated":"2016-05-06 04:46:48","minute":"4:46 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/06\/why-ibm-is-excited-about-the-special-partnership-between-apple-sap\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/06\/why-ibm-is-excited-about-the-special-partnership-between-apple-sap\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/06\/why-ibm-is-excited-about-the-special-partnership-between-apple-sap\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Why IBM Welcomes the Apple-SAP Alliance","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/anil-shivman-photo-for-bl.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy of IBM","caption":"","attach_id":"1650800"},"excerpt":"<p>Get ready for highly personal, consumer-grade business apps.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"462565","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/heather-clancy\/","name":"Heather Clancy","twitter":"GreenTechLady","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/clancy-heather.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Heather Clancy\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/clancy-heather.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Heather Clancy is a contributing editor to <em>Fortune<\/em> and the author of Data Sheet, <em>Fortune<\/em>'s daily newsletter about the business of technology.","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":318,"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46728,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News, analysis, and insight into technology and business, including Silicon Valley giants like Apple, Google, Facebook, and our annual Brainstorm Tech conference.","parent":0,"count":28439,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tech\/","newsletter_info":"Data Sheet"},"tags":[{"term_id":431387947,"name":"Zeroing In","slug":"zeroing-in","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":161908,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":45,"filter":"raw"}],"has_commentary_tag":false,"primary_tag":{"name":"Zeroing In","slug":"zeroing-in","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/zeroing-in\/"},"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"Get ready for highly personal, consumer-grade business apps.","seo":{"seo_title":"Why IBM Is Excited About the \u2018Special Partnership\u2019 Between Apple, SAP","seo_description":"SAP plus IBM plus Apple.

even deeper into the future of virtual currency.<\/p>\n<p>Dolfi M\u00fcller, Zug&#8217;s social-democratic mayor, <a

It is fairly good at protecting anonymity, but uses a public ledger system, called the blockchain, that is excellent at keeping track of transactions.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably highly relevant that bitcoin&#8217;s transaction costs are low.

meaning behind grocery chain Fairway&#8217;s name is pretty straightforward: It is supposed to convey &#8220;fair prices.&#8221; And when the New York-based retailer went public in the spring of 2013, investors thought they found a bargain.<\/p>\n<p>Shares of Fairway <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424127887323309604578428510412119762\">jumped<\/a> 33% on the first day of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, a bet that the grocery chain \u2013 with just 11 stores in the greater New York City area \u2013 could <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1555492\/000104746912009058\/a2211056zs-1.htm\">expand the concept<\/a> to more than 300 across the U.S., a target outlined in the initial Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The stock surged an additional 60% over the next three months, valuing Fairway at a little over $835 million at the company&#8217;s peak. That&#8217;s $75 million per existing store at the time.<\/p>\n<p>This week, stakeholders saw their investment officially wiped out after Fairway <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/03\/fairway-grocery-store-bankruptcy\/\">filed for bankruptcy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What went wrong?

The bet for all three was essentially the same: consumers are buying more natural and organic foods and these grocery chains appeal to that crowd. Perhaps they could grow to become the next Whole Foods <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"wfm\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/whole-foods-market-214\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">wfm<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>But importantly, not all of those chains were selling the same story to Wall Street. When Sprouts filed to go public, it had 157 stores across eight states. Revenue totaled nearly $2 billion and it was profitable. Fresh Market generated over $860 million in revenue, posted healthy profits, and operated a fleet of 95 stores in 19 states.<\/p>\n<p>Fairway didn&#8217;t have as compelling of a case. Though it claimed its high-volume stores were among the most productive in the industry, there were several red flags. It wasn&#8217;t profitable. Same-store sales had slipped pretty badly for the most recently two fiscal years: down 5% in 2011 and 7% in 2012. Average net sales per store per week tumbled from $1,642 in fiscal 2009 to $1,246 just four years later.<\/p>\n<iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-5b1846eecf3801175c361ff8d40908ee17fc8684\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/xTJIH\/1\/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-5b1846eecf3801175c361ff8d40908ee17fc8684\" width=\"545\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<p>&#8220;Successful IPOs should have already demonstrated a track record of opening new stores, strong comparable sales growth and the ability to manage debt,&#8221; said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at IPO ETF manager Renaissance Capital. &#8220;Fairway failed on any of those measures.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Whole Foods Problem<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the years that Fairway was a public company, it added a few stores \u2013 expanding to 15 locations currently \u2013 but continued to report declining same-store sales and average sales per week, both key metrics that judge the health of a retailer. It also misfired on expansion. Notably, Fairway had to book a $3.5 million charge to cover the cost of terminating a lease in the Hudson Yards section of Manhattan.<\/p>\n<p>And while bigger grocery stores flooded the New York market that Fairway had called home for 83 years, one store in particular caused big problems. A single Whole Foods <a href=\"http:\/\/media.wholefoodsmarket.com\/news\/whole-foods-market-set-to-open-upper-east-side-location-on-february-18th\">location<\/a> that opened in the wealthy Upper East Side section of the city in February 2015.<\/p>\n<iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-88b0a26d02a0274aa6888cb48b46078cb1544999\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"\/\/datawrapper.dwcdn.net\/mncuD\/1\/?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-88b0a26d02a0274aa6888cb48b46078cb1544999\" width=\"545\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<p>Just three months later, Fairway executives were blaming sales declines on competition from just that single store. Same-store sales slipped 3.6%, but would have dropped a less severe 2.7% excluding the Upper East Side location. Over the next two quarters, management would call out that store&#8217;s problematic double-digit decline drop in sales as a factor that was hurting sales.<\/p>\n<p>The expansion of Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#8217;s in New York made it tough for Fairway to compete, especially considering profit margins in the world of grocery are already relatively thin. And consumers have been increasingly lured by mobile ordering for groceries \u2013 Amazon, Fresh Direct and others play in that space \u2013 make it an increasingly difficult environment to operate in.<\/p>\n<p>By October 2015, executives at Fairway were promising to &#8220;flood the boroughs with Fairways,&#8221; said Fairway CEO Jack Murphy at the time. &#8220;We believe that is the most important and easy way for us to grow this company both profitably and with responsibility to our shareholders.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But earlier in that conference call, Fairway&#8217;s own CFO Ed Arditte conceded the high debt on Fairway&#8217;s balance sheet would constrain any long-term plans the grocery chain had in place.

They paid him $3.8 million for 2015.<\/p>\n<p>What did he do for this money? As it turns out, not much.<\/p>\n<p>Redstone hadn\u2019t been seen or heard at an investor presentation by either company since 2014. At CBS\u2019s annual gathering in Los Angeles that May, a curtain hid Redstone\u2014always too proud to use a wheelchair\u2014as burly men carried him onto the stage, where they deposited him into a seat beside the other directors.<\/p>\n<p>Since a hospitalization for pneumonia that September, Redstone, who has difficulty swallowing his own saliva, has labored to utter a sentence. Inside his Beverly Hills mansion, he requires a nurse to serve as his interpreter. CBS\u2019s Nov. 5 earnings call began with a halting \u201copening remark\u201d from Redstone: \u201cThis is Sumner. Welcome to the CBS Corp. event.\u201d Eight days later, he was heard, barely, on Viacom\u2019s quarterly conference call, weakly slurring eight words introducing CEO Philippe Dauman: \u201cGood morning everyone. Here\u2019s my wise friend, Philippe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtr1dft7.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648736\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtr1dft7.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=659\" alt=\"Viacom Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone addresses guests at the MTV studios in Istanbul\" width=\"1024\" height=\"659\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Sumner Redstone addresses guests at MTV&#8217;s Istanbul studios in 2006.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Fatih Saribas \u2014 Reuters<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Redstone attended his last company board meetings in person in 2014, too. According to a witness to one session, he dozed and drooled during the proceedings. At subsequent events, Redstone\u2019s fellow directors were routinely advised that he was listening in by phone from his hilltop mansion in Beverly Hills. But according to medical logs recorded by Redstone\u2019s round-the-clock nurses, sometimes he just slept.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>At 8:30 a.m. this Friday, in a windowless, sixth-floor courtroom in downtown Los Angeles, testimony will begin to resolve what would normally remain an exquisitely private matter: Who should make health care decisions for an old man when he\u2019s unable to make them for himself? Redstone is a man who, for decades, dominated those around him. Now diminished, by some accounts a wraith, he is not expected even to be in the courtroom at a trial that centers on what condition he\u2019s in. He will be questioned by each side for 15 minutes at home (the videotaped deposition will be shown only to the judge). Even that small amount of testimony might be too much for him.<\/p>\n<p>At center stage in the trial that begins Friday is Manuela Herzer, 51, Redstone\u2019s Argentine-born housemate-turned-castoff. Herzer instigated this court proceeding after she was ousted from Redstone&#8217;s mansion\u2014and from his will. Her lawyers will argue that Redstone was incapacitated and not competent to make such a decision and that, as a result, she should be restored to her place in his life (which would also restore her in his bequests).<\/p>\n<p>There will be testimony that Redstone, while continuing as executive chairman of Viacom and CBS was, in truth \u201ca living ghost\u201d\u2014largely reduced to tears and grunts, and incapable of plotting strategy for two giant public companies.<\/p>\n<p>We will likely hear about his delusional daily demands for steak and sex, and about scheduled visits to his gated Beverly Hills mansion by a woman paid to pretend to meet his carnal desires while a male nurse stood by watching. There will be testimony about the infidelity of the mogul\u2019s 44-year-old girlfriend, Sydney Holland, who shared Redstone\u2019s mansion; about his bitter estrangement from his daughter Shari; and Herzer\u2019s claim that Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, Redstone\u2019s intensely loyal prot\u00e9g\u00e9, lied to hide his boss\u2019s incapacity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-0\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"0\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Herzer, who asserts Redstone was non <em>compos mentis<\/em> and under undue influence last October when she was ordered out of his house and replaced as his health care agent, will swear that she is motivated purely by her love for him, that she\u2019s merely seeking to fulfill her vow to care for Redstone to his dying day.<\/p>\n<p>Lawyers representing the billionaire will tell a quite different tale. That the two women who lived in his house conspired to cut him off from family and friends. That Herzer is simply a cunning, stylish gold digger, who launched her legal jihad to preserve Redstone\u2019s $70-million bequest to her in his will. And that Redstone, despite his feeble speech, remains mentally competent to make his own decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, <em>Fortune<\/em> has learned that Redstone&#8217;s lawyers are planning to intensify the legal conflict even more. The lawyers confirm they will soon file a new suit against Herzer and Holland, claiming elder abuse, among other things, and seeking to reclaim nearly $150 million that the billionaire gave these women in recent years. (Lawyers for Holland and Herzer have adamantly denied any misconduct by their clients.)<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s beyond dispute is that this fight has sent shock waves through Redstone\u2019s vast empire. It was this tawdry case\u2014and not a planned corporate succession or steps taken by either board\u2014that forced his belated departure as chairman of the two companies in February, despite his repeated vows that he\u2019d never step down. (He also claimed he\u2019d never die.) It has focused attention on the business woes at Viacom, where profits are faltering, the creative and digital strategies seem suspect, and the stock has dropped 39% in the past year. And it has prompted CBS chief Leslie Moonves to start quietly maneuvering to get out from under the Redstone family\u2019s thumb altogether, according to a Reuters report. (&#8220;We look at everything that is available out there,&#8221; Moonves said when asked about the report on a recent earnings call. &#8220;We are not going to comment on any rumors that have been floating around.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>It also triggered the first salvos in a looming battle for control of the companies, where Redstone, despite it all, commands 80% of the voting shares. At CBS, Shari Redstone (who serves as vice chair of both companies) backed the board\u2019s decision in early February to award her father\u2019s executive chairman title to CEO Leslie Moonves. But at Viacom, she cast the lone vote against promoting the embattled Dauman, her father\u2019s anointed CEO, suggesting she wants to oust him.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15%;width:60%;padding-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_418044f.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648707\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_418044f.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1531\" alt=\"'THE ITALIAN JOB' FILM PREMIERE, HOLLYWOOD, AMERICA - 27 MAY 2003\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1531\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone at his 80th birthday party in 2003 as his daughter Shari and granddaughter Kim look on.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by E Charbonneau \u2014 BEI\/REX\/Shutterstock<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The trial might seem like a mere detour into the seamy details of a billionaire\u2019s decline. But in fact the corporate stakes are dramatically higher than that. In fact, the trial could lead to a change in control at both CBS and Viacom. A finding by the judge in the case that Redstone is not competent could trigger a provision in the trust that holds his 80% of the voting shares of both companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Control would then pass from Redstone to the trust\u2019s seven trustees. They include Shari Redstone and Dauman\u2014and several trustees whose future votes are uncertain. If she wins, Dauman might swiftly be gone. If Dauman prevails, he\u2019ll extend his influence beyond Viacom, to CBS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An already bitter conflict born of the maneuvers inside Redstone\u2019s household, it seems, could reshape $40 billion worth of corporations and the lives of thousands of employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>Sumner Redstone\u2019s personal and business lives have always been deeply\u2014often painfully\u2014intertwined. Redstone is an extraordinary man. He built an empire, changed the media landscape, popularized a business mantra (\u201cContent is king!\u201d), amassed a fortune, and has given generously to charity.<\/p>\n<p>But he\u2019s no storybook victim; he made himself an easy mark. If scheming women decades younger sought to pick his bulging pockets, Redstone\u2014who hungered for their adoring company\u2014virtually invited them to do so. And before anyone isolated the billionaire from family and friends, he drove many of them off himself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-1\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"1\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an epic saga. This account is based on interviews with dozens of people, including Herzer, current and former high-ranking executives of Viacom and CBS, people close to Redstone and his family, witnesses to events at his mansion, and lawyers in the case, as well as hundreds of pages of court records and documents. Three of the principals, Redstone, his daughter Shari, and Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, declined to be interviewed. However, representatives for each of them spoke to <em>Fortune<\/em> at length. As befits a baroque conflict in which everybody suspects everybody else\u2019s motives, many participants insisted on speaking under cloak of anonymity.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-563992443.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647936\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-563992443.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, left, and Chairman Sumner Redstone photographed at Redstone's home in B\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, left, and Redstone at Redstone&#8217;s Beverly Hills home in 2007.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Mel Melcon\u2014LA Times via Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the end, Redstone\u2019s corporate affairs fell into disarray because he stubbornly refused to put his house in order\u2014scoffing at succession plans, appointing pliant boards, and running his $40 billion enterprise like a family grocery store.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s seductive\u2014and fitting\u2014to think about the drama surrounding Redstone and his companies as a real-life <em>Game of Thrones<\/em>. A mad king, obsessed with irrational lusts, sits at its center, oblivious to the chaos he has set in motion. Ancient feuds motivate scheming rivals, who claim to act in the king\u2019s name. Alliances are transactional and transitory. Spies loom. Betrayals abound. Romantic and personal ties often serve as a path to wealth and power. The sexual imagery is cringe worthy. Winter is finally coming to Sumner Redstone. The wise player in the game trusts no one.<\/p>\n<p>Redstone is a psychiatrist\u2019s field day: a mix of breathtaking self-absorption, brutal drive, and primal wants, steeped in a painful childhood. In 2006, while staying with relatives in New Jersey over the Christmas holidays, he was furious to discover the Dec. 24 TV broadcast of his beloved New England Patriots was to be blacked out in favor of the local New York Giants\u2019 game. Redstone knew there was a satellite dish on Viacom\u2019s jet, parked at the Morristown, N.J., airport. He ordered members of the flight crew out of their homes on the afternoon before Christmas to fire up the plane and have it towed out onto the tarmac, where he could get a strong enough signal to watch his game. And there everyone remained, late into the afternoon on Christmas Eve, until the final whistle on a narrow Patriots victory.<\/p>\n<p>In business, Redstone was relentless. During a fierce bidding war for Paramount, he decided to sue America\u2019s reigning cable-system titan, who was then backing a rival bid. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sue John Malone,\u201d MTV Networks chief Tom Freston, one of his top deputies, advised Redstone. \u201cHe\u2019s our biggest distributor.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/family-tree-1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649489\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/family-tree-1.png?w=370&#038;h=420\" alt=\"family-tree (1)\" width=\"370\" height=\"420\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Redstone stood up, walked over to Freston, and bellowed at him: \u201cNobody shits in my mouth!\u201d Viacom sued Malone\u2019s company (claiming antitrust violations), Malone retreated, and Redstone won Paramount.<\/p>\n<p>Christine Peters, a Hollywood producer and onetime Redstone flame, recalls sitting down for dinner at a restaurant in Hawaii with her daughters and the mogul, then about 80, when his steak arrived overdone.

Most of it focused on whether Sumner had swindled his relatives in winning control of the family\u2019s movie-theater business, called National Amusements. Eddie sued his brother, Sumner, and father, Mickey. Brent Redstone, Sumner\u2019s son, accused his father and sister Shari of self-dealing and misappropriating millions of dollars. Nephew Michael (Eddie\u2019s son) sued his dad and uncle Sumner.<\/p>\n<p>The bitterness transcended the courtroom. Sumner and his son Brent haven\u2019t spoken in a decade. Eddie died in 2011; Sumner didn\u2019t attend his brother\u2019s funeral. And the conflict has now extended into a fourth generation: Brent\u2019s daughter Keryn has sided with Manuela Herzer, battling against Shari Redstone and her children.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the contentiousness shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise: Mickey, the family patriarch, who operated Boston nightclubs he\u2019d started with money from an infamous local mobster, kept a set of brass knuckles in his desk. In 1936 he launched what became National Amusements, then a small chain of drive-ins. This closely held private company would serve as the battleground for the family warfare\u2014and the vehicle for Sumner\u2019s audacious billion-dollar deals. National Amusements holds Redstone\u2019s controlling stakes in Viacom and CBS today.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Boston in 1923, Sumner Redstone was preternaturally smart and ruthlessly ambitious, a workaholic bent on winning every fight. Even as he excelled in his studies, driven by a pitiless mother, he remained a discontented outsider. \u201cI had no social life. I had no friends,\u201d Redstone wrote of his high school years in his autobiography.<\/p>\n<p>His college years at Harvard, it seems, were similarly barren. Redstone \u201cprobably had an unhappy and rather lonely time at the college,\u201d noted a memo prepared for a 1983 Harvard fundraising drive, based on information from a classics professor who knew Redstone. \u201cHe probably still harbors some feelings of insecurity and resentment against Harvard \u2018snobs.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 1954, Redstone abandoned a lucrative corporate tax-law practice to join National Amusements. That\u2019s when the family trouble began. Sumner soon became his father\u2019s heir apparent, squeezing out Eddie, who had gone to work there two years earlier after graduating from Harvard Business School.<\/p>\n<p>Eddie grew increasingly bitter about how his father and brother were treating him and finally quit in 1971. Threatening to sell his 40% stake to an outsider, he sued Sumner and their father, prompting his mother to tell Eddie that he had \u201cbrought disgrace on you, our family and all of us.\u201d Eddie wrote back, \u201cUnder all the laws of God, there is no justification for Sumner\u2019s and Dad\u2019s activities\u2026.The immorality\u2026.is almost beyond belief.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/companions-tree-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649599\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/companions-tree-2.png?w=370&#038;h=530\" alt=\"companions-tree (2)\" width=\"370\" height=\"530\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>The dispute was settled, like most Redstone problems, with cash. Eddie received $5 million (and went on to become a successful banker); Sumner gained control of National Amusements, partly through a provision placing him in charge of trusts holding shares for his and Eddie\u2019s children. In a noteworthy bit of self-dealing that would come under attack in future family litigation, Sumner later had National Amusements purchase most of these shares from the trusts for $21.4 million, boosting his personal stake to 67%. Sumner\u2019s children, Shari and Brent, held the remaining 33%.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-3\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"3\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>National Amusements thrived under Sumner, replacing drive-ins with upscale indoor \u201cmultiplex cinemas\u201d (a term it trademarked), eventually growing to more than 1,000 screens across the country and overseas.<\/p>\n<p>Within the industry, Redstone made his mark with litigation that no one else would have dared: He sued the Hollywood studios (his industry\u2019s supplier) to end their practice of making theaters bid to book films sight unseen. Litigation was a treasured business weapon. As he put it decades after leaving the legal profession, \u201cI practice law every day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nothing seemed to slow Sumner. He famously survived a 1979 fire at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston that severely burned half his body, requiring months of excruciating skin grafts and transforming his right hand into a purplish claw that he\u2019d gnaw on when lost in thought. (He later resumed playing tennis by strapping a racquet onto his arm.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-514870696.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647951\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/gettyimages-514870696.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Firemen On Ladder At Flame-Engulfed Wind\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">The 1979 fire at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Bettmann\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With firm control of the family business, Redstone in the 1980s began using National Amusements to make ever-larger investments in publicly traded entertainment companies. But he remained little known outside of the Boston business community.<\/p>\n<p>That changed in 1987, with his $3.4-billion victory in a bidding war for Viacom, then an underperforming media conglomerate that had acquired its most promising assets\u2014MTV, Nickelodeon, and Showtime\u2014just two years earlier. Overnight, Redstone became a man who mattered to Wall Street, Hollywood, and gossip columnists\u2014at the age of 64.<\/p>\n<p>Other improbable deals followed. Viacom snatched up Paramount for $10 billion in 1994 and CBS in 2000, besting moguls like Barry Diller in frenzied bidding wars. Wall Street wisdom held that Redstone routinely overpaid in his obsession to win each new prize. He wanted desperately to overtake Time Warner, and make Viacom the biggest media company on the planet (a goal he never achieved).<\/p>\n<p>Despite Wall Street\u2019s skepticism, Redstone\u2019s acquisitions paid off. Viacom\u2014driven by fast growth at MTV and Nickelodeon and syndication profits (it bought distribution rights to <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>)\u2014became a cash machine. Focused on younger viewers, its basic-cable programming, including hits like <em>South Park<\/em> and <em>SpongeBob Squarepants<\/em>, drew ever-higher ratings, boosting ad sales and distribution. In 2000, Redstone\u2019s personal net worth peaked, by a <em>Forbes<\/em> estimate, at $14 billion (it\u2019s now about $5.2 billion).<\/p>\n<p>In the early years, Redstone left his operating executives alone. Waking at 4 a.m., he began his day by studying the overnight grosses for his movie theaters. Arriving at the office, he obsessed over just a few things: the gyrations of Viacom\u2019s stock, key strategic moves (especially lawsuits), and the next transaction. Recalls Frank Biondi, who Redstone hired as CEO after buying Viacom: \u201cSumner said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know the day-to-day businesses. All I want to do is be involved in the deals. When we do deals, bring them to me\u2014I\u2019m good at it.&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Redstone reveled in his late-life stature as a mogul. He loved appearing on magazine covers and in gossip columns. He carefully monitored his standing on Hollywood power lists. In 2001, Simon &amp; Schuster, a Viacom subsidiary, published and heavily promoted Redstone\u2019s memoir, <em>A Passion to Win<\/em>, in which he airbrushed his messy personal history, writing of his \u201cintimate, loving relationship\u201d with family.<\/p>\n<p>Though Viacom was publicly traded and governed by a board of directors, Redstone, through National Amusements, owned most of its Class A voting shares, making it subject to his every whim. It was a fact he never let anyone forget. \u201cViacom is me. I\u2019m Viacom,\u201d he gleefully <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/1999\/04\/26\/sumner-redstone-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\">declared to <em>Fortune<\/em> in 1999<\/a>. \u201cThat marriage is eternal, forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other bonds were not. Redstone\u2019s wife, Phyllis, who he\u2019d wed in 1947, had raised their two children, Shari and Brent, in Newton, a Boston suburb. But at least since the 1970s, Sumner had openly carried on an affair with Delsa Weiner, a doctor\u2019s wife and mother of four who lived down the street. (Weiner, who divorced her husband in 1977, later became a writer and changed her name to Winer.)<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-left:15%;width:60%;padding-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5133097a.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648727\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5133097a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1479\" alt=\"'Good Burger' Premiere\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1479\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone and wife, Phyllis, in Los Angeles, 1997.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by BEI\/REX\/Shutterstock<\/span><\/div>\n<p>In fact\u2014though Redstone never mentioned this detail in his frequent recountings of the Copley Square hotel fire \u2014Winer was in his suite with him that night, escaping with far less severe burns. In 1988 (as a <em>Boston <\/em>magazine article first reported), a trust administered by Redstone\u2019s personal attorney bought her a four-bedroom home in Lincoln, Mass., on a wooded 17-acre tract, for $1.75 million. A subsequent mortgage amendment listed Redstone as the co-borrower and stated that he was living there.<\/p>\n<p>This was just one element of the awkwardness that Redstone\u2019s odd personal life has always posed for his family\u2014and for Viacom. Winer at times accompanied Redstone at corporate events, including a business trip on the Viacom jet to Thailand, where the couple spent one evening visiting sex clubs. He introduced his mistress to a Viacom executive as \u201can old friend and a poet.\u201d When Winer died in 2013, at age 86, her children identified her in an obituary as a \u201cdear friend of Sumner Redstone for many years,\u201d and included a snapshot of the two together among the family photos.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this, Phyllis and Sumner\u2014known for bickering nonstop on cross-country flights\u2014clung for a half-century to a marriage that Sumner later said was \u201crocky from day one.\u201d They sued one another for divorce three times (Phyllis twice, Sumner once). Each time, they somehow patched things up.<\/p>\n<p>Then in 1997, Redstone became smitten with Christine Peters, a striking 44-year-old divorced Paramount producer. Peters was a business partner with Redstone\u2019s old friend Bob Evans, the Hollywood raconteur and ladies man who helped launch the <em>Godfather<\/em> films and <em>Chinatown<\/em>. Redstone vacationed with Peters in Sardinia and Hawaii and began staying at her Bel Air estate during his frequent business trips to Los Angeles. Redstone arranged for his most trusted Viacom lieutenants, Philippe Dauman and Tom Dooley, to fly out to L.A. from New York for dinner at Peters\u2019s home, so they could assess her and offer Redstone their views on the relationship. (In later years, he came to care less about his subordinates\u2019 view of his female companions.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-4\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"4\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In May 1999, Redstone flew to Paris to join Peters, who was touring the city with her mother and two daughters. There, a private detective hired by Phyllis photographed Redstone and Peters strolling hand-in-hand. Phyllis\u2019 lawyers provided the photo to the <em>New York Post<\/em>, along with the news that she was suing Sumner for divorce yet again\u2014and meant it this time. With the filing, and leaked warnings that Phyllis wanted half of his then-$6 billion fortune, Wall Street feared the split would imperil the mammoth CBS acquisition, then underway. Redstone rushed to assure everyone: \u201cNothing that takes place in my personal life will have anything to do with the management and control of Viacom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The truth was just the opposite: Redstone\u2019s personal life would determine the control of Viacom, both then and more than a decade into the future. If Phyllis got half her husband\u2019s two-thirds stake in National Amusements, Shari and Brent (who each owned one-sixth) could align with their mother to control the business. Sumner began maneuvering to eliminate that possibility.<\/p>\n<p>By then, Brent was 50 and living on a ranch outside Colorado. He\u2019d moved there after 14 years as a prosecutor in Boston, followed by a short, unhappy stint working for his father at Viacom. Also a lawyer, Shari, then 46, had abandoned other career plans to help her father run the Boston-based theater business. She became president of National Amusements in January 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Both Brent and Shari served on the Sumner-friendly boards of National Amusements and Viacom, where they helped set their father\u2019s pay as members of the compensation committee. Redstone, rough on everyone around him, was particularly brutal on his offspring. Still, Brent would later contend, he\u2019d assured them they\u2019d take over the business someday.<\/p>\n<p>With a divorce settlement under discussion with Phyllis, Sumner began pressuring his children to give him voting control over their stakes in National Amusements. After Shari agreed but Brent refused, their father began treating Shari \u201cwith extreme favoritism,\u201d while freezing him out of the business and ousting him from the Viacom board, Brent would later claim.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, Sumner struck a deal with his wife and daughter to assure his grip on the empire, while setting the stage for Shari\u2019s rise. The Redstones\u2019 divorce agreement gave Phyllis half of all distributions from his 80% stake in National Amusements during her lifetime, while allowing him to retain voting control over of all his shares in the holding company\u2014and thus Viacom. Sumner also signed an agreement to let Shari succeed him as nonexecutive chair of his companies. Sumner&#8217;s shares were placed in an irrevocable trust to benefit their five grandchildren. Once he died or became incapacitated, the trust\u2014governed by seven trustees, including Shari and one of her sons\u2014would take control of his shares.<\/p>\n<p>In the settlement\u2019s aftermath, Sumner publicly promoted his daughter to the media as his likely successor, calling her \u201ca great businesswoman\u201d with \u201cno major weakness.\u201d He named her nonexecutive vice-chair of Viacom in June 2005. A <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em> profile portrayed her as \u201ca magnate-in-waiting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In February 2006, Brent sued National Amusements, saying he\u2019d been frozen out for defying his father\u2019s \u201cnaked attempt\u201d to gain \u201ccomplete control.\u201d He accused Sumner\u2014and his sister\u2014of misappropriating millions in National Amusements assets for their personal benefit, including transferring a multimillion-dollar suite at the Pierre Hotel to Phyllis as a \u201cpayoff\u201d in Sumner\u2019s divorce. (Viacom says Sumner paid for it.) Brent demanded a breakup of the business, citing \u201cthe oppressive acts of those in control.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The suit was settled a year later, with a reported $240-million buyout for Brent\u2019s shares, boosting Sumner\u2019s voting stake in National Amusements to 80%. (Shari has the rest.) In the battle\u2019s aftermath, Sumner stopped speaking to his son. Inside Viacom, recalls one executive, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to talk about Brent. He didn\u2019t exist.\u201d Asked later why he\u2019d moved to Denver, Brent replied: \u201cBecause there were no direct flights from Boston.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With his control assured, Sumner, who seemed constitutionally incapable of sticking with any plan that envisioned his departure (much less his demise), retreated from his commitment to Shari. Father and daughter had suffered from a contentious personal relationship for decades. Back in 1984, he\u2019d complained bitterly in a letter about her \u201clack of regard\u201d and \u201cdisdain\u201d for him. \u201cThey were like oil and water,\u201d says one longtime Redstone colleague. \u201cHe never gave her anything unless he needed to do it. Everything came out of some fight, some threatened lawsuit. It\u2019s a family history that\u2019s more about horse trading than affection.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now in business together, they battled over matters large and small, especially the prospects for the movie-theater company, which she continued to run. She wanted to spend heavily to expand internationally; he wanted to sell it. One executive who knew her described Shari as \u201cSumner in a skirt,\u201d but Redstone had concluded she wasn\u2019t fit to fill his shoes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1645938-5\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"5\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>He began belittling his daughter\u2019s business acumen in public\u2014and disparaged her more harshly in private. In 2007, Redstone dispatched a dismissive letter about Shari to <em>Forbes<\/em>: \u201cIt must be remembered that I gave to my children their stock; and it is I, with little or no contribution on their part, who built these great media companies\u2026.\u201d On multiple occasions, according to witnesses, Redstone called his daughter a \u201cc&#8211;t\u201d\u2014in at least one case, at a Viacom board meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Redstone had signed an agreement providing that Shari would succeed him\u2014and publicly noted that his anointed directors had \u201cnever gone against my wishes.\u201d Yet in 2007, he began taking a dramatically different position. He now insisted the question was out of his hands, that good corporate governance demanded the directors pick his successor. If that wasn\u2019t satisfactory, he said he would consider buying out his daughter\u2019s 20% interest in National Amusements\u2014for the right price. Shari hired a lawyer, and pondered pursuing the course of so many previous Redstones: suing Sumner.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>By then, Redstone had already abruptly fired three highly regarded potential successors. In 1996, he canned Viacom CEO Biondi, who had overseen the company\u2019s growth from $1 billion to $12 billion in revenues. Biondi says Redstone told him he now knew the business well enough to run it himself. Redstone also grumbled that Biondi, who took regular family vacations and rarely dined with him, didn\u2019t work hard enough.<\/p>\n<p>Already executive chairman, Redstone took the CEO title for himself for the next nine years. In 2000, upon merging with CBS, he named its hard-nosed chief, Mel Karmazin, as Viacom\u2019s COO. Redstone publicly insisted they could co-exist, and proclaimed him his likely successor. Biondi says he warned Karmazin that if he was taking the job on the assumption that he could outlast the much older Redstone, \u201cyou\u2019re in for a rude awakening.\u201d Four years later, after the stock dropped, Karmazin (whom Redstone had taken to calling \u201cKarma-fuck\u201d) was gone.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5135244a.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1648732\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rexfeatures_5135244a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=760\" alt=\"'Star Trek' The Experience\" width=\"1024\" height=\"760\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone with wife and three of their grandchildren, Las Vegas 1998.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by BEI\/REX\/Shutterstock<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Redstone next decided to split Viacom and CBS into separate companies, just five years after combining them. He named Freston, the widely admired chief of MTV Networks\u2014he\u2019d helped launch the business in 1981\u2014as Viacom\u2019s CEO (and his latest presumptive heir). Leslie Moonves became CEO of CBS.<\/p>\n<p>The maneuver was a stock play, driven by Redstone\u2019s belief that CBS would appeal to value investors, while Viacom, then far larger, would appeal to the growth crowd. (Analysts dubbed them \u201cVia-Slow\u201d and \u201cVia-Grow.\u201d) But amid a declining market, Viacom\u2019s shares continued to slide, while CBS prospered. Redstone fired Freston in September 2006, just eight months into his tenure, citing his unhappiness about the stock and the company\u2019s failure to make a big Internet acquisition, after archrival Rupert Murdoch outbid Viacom for MySpace.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe worst part was that Rupert was being [hailed] as some great old-media guy who reinvented himself, and Sumner was not,\u201d recalls Freston. \u201cIt was like a stone in his shoe.\u201d Redstone later told an interviewer the loss to Murdoch was \u201chumiliating.\u201d (The MySpace acquisition turned out to be a disaster.) When Freston, who had been at MTV for 25 years, returned to clean out his office, some 2,500 employees mobbed the lobby of Viacom\u2019s Times Square headquarters, shouting his name, to say farewell.<\/p>\n<p>Re-enter Redstone\u2019s closest business confidant: Philippe Pierre Dauman. The two men had met at the outset of the battle for Viacom, when Dauman was a 32-year-old corporate-law associate at Shearman &amp; Sterling. He\u2019d served as Redstone\u2019s <em>consigliere<\/em> ever since. For his part, Redstone seemed to show more fatherly affection toward Dauman than he did to his actual children.<\/p>\n<p>Dauman joined the Viacom board after the takeover, then became general counsel in 1993. Redstone also named him a director of National Amusements and co-executor of his estate. In 1999, Dauman departed to make room for Karmazin, though he remained a Viacom director and received a $34-million exit package. Dauman launched a private equity firm with executive vice president Tom Dooley, another Redstone intimate who departed. But with Freston\u2019s September 2006 dismissal, both immediately returned\u2014with Dauman as CEO. (Dooley is now chief operating officer.)<\/p>\n<p>Dauman, a natty dresser, is whip smart: He scored a perfect 1600 on his SATs\u2014at age 13\u2014and later complained of being bored with his studies at Yale, after entering the university at 16. Yet from his start as CEO, he came under attack as a creatively challenged suit, miscast atop a youth-focused content company. The hip, culture-savvy Freston declared nothing out of bounds at Viacom \u201cexcept frontal nudity.\u201d When Dauman, during a management offsite a year after taking over, presented a list of 10 &#8220;organizing principles&#8221; that included &#8220;civility,&#8221; everyone snickered.<\/p>\n<p>Dauman defined his early tenure with a Redstone-esque move\u2014filing a $1 billion lawsuit in March 2007 against YouTube and its parent, Google, charging \u201cbrazen\u201d copyright infringement. Dauman wanted Viacom to be paid for the clips YouTube regularly posted without permission from popular Viacom programs, such as Jon Stewart\u2019s <em>Daily Show<\/em>, <em>South Park<\/em>, and <em>SpongeBob Squarepants<\/em>. At one point, Google offered $900 million for rights to Viacom clips. But Dauman rejected the deal (a spokesperson asserts the money wasn&#8217;t guaranteed and the terms were &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;). In the meantime, as Dauman demanded, YouTube removed all traces of Viacom programming, depriving its shows of a hot new platform for marketing to young viewers. A federal judge twice threw the case out on summary judgment, and after seven years and millions in legal fees, Viacom ended up with nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Despite his background as an M&amp;A lawyer, Dauman made few moves to broaden Viacom\u2019s meager digital footprint\u2014a failure that would come to plague the company. Instead, he focused on boosting Viacom\u2019s shares through another gambit out of the Redstone playbook: a massive stock-buyback program. By mid-2007, Viacom shares were up 23%. \u201cI don\u2019t think you ask for anything more,\u201d Redstone told a reporter.<\/p>\n<p>[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>For all his irascibility, Redstone seemed desperate for the constant companionship\u2014and adoration\u2014of the opposite sex. Even before his messy divorce from Phyllis became final in July 2002, he had proposed marriage to three different women.<\/p>\n<p>One of them was Peters, whose Paris rendezvous with Redstone had been the flashpoint for his divorce. Peters\u2019s unwillingness to marry Redstone\u2014she thought he was too old and didn\u2019t care enough about her career or family\u2014infuriated the billionaire. In October 2000, he faxed her an angry, intensely personal letter he\u2019d dictated to his secretary. \u201cYou ruined my life twice,\u201d Redstone wrote. \u201cYou ruined the life that I had before you\u2014not your fault\u2014but you ruined it. You ruined the second life that I had with you\u2026..I rue the day I ever met you\u2026.I hate you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even in his vitriolic letter to his lover, Redstone couldn\u2019t stop himself from talking business. He ranted about Karmazin, then his CBS merger partner. Publicly, Redstone had avowed his respect for Karmazin and declared him his heir apparent. To Peters, Redstone wrote that Karmazin had \u201cinsulted\u201d and \u201cabused\u201d him, by refusing to show proper deference. \u201cWhy go on? I will get rid of him in 2 \u00bd years. [Karmazin would be gone in four.] I will get rid of you now\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A week later, a calmer Redstone wrote her again to pledge his friendship, while lamenting her priorities. \u201cSomeday, perhaps, you will realize there is more to life than your children and your career and that if there is a man in your life who is important to you, you will protect and defend him\u2014maybe exalt him\u2014but never diminish him\u2026..\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In April 2003, months after his divorce from Phyllis was final, Redstone, then 79, married Paula Fortunato, a 40-year-old New York City elementary school teacher from New Jersey. His stockbroker had set them up. Their lavish wedding reception was held at the New York Public Library, where Tony Bennett sang. (He\u2019d been friendly with Redstone ever since MTV helped resurrect his career.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtrlgdq.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647963\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/rtrlgdq.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"SUMNER REDSTONE AND PAULA FORTUNATO LEAVE NEW YORK TEMPLE AFTERWEDDING.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Redstone and Paula Fortunato on their wedding day in 2003.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Chip East\u2014Reuters<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPaula\u2019s a nice girl,\u201d one Viacom executive in attendance recalls Redstone telling his guests. \u201cNot the most beautiful girl. But she knows I love Viacom first and foremost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Redstone relocated with his new bride to Los Angeles, where he\u2019d bought a $14.5-million mansion in Beverly Park, a gated celebrity enclave whose residents include Sylvester Stallone, Rod Stewart, and Denzel Washington. Redstone\u2019s 15,355-square-foot home featured five bedrooms, eight baths, indoor and outdoor pools, a tennis court, and fountains. Inside his hilltop enclave, Redstone ran his empire by phone from a lounge chair in his study, lined with giant tanks containing saltwater fish, which fascinated him. (He boasted of owning the world\u2019s largest private collection.)<\/p>\n<p>The marriage seemed to begin well, with friendly media profiles declaring that Redstone had finally achieved domestic bliss. Paula called him \u201cPuppy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But life with Redstone soon turned into screaming fights. Christine Peters, who remained friends with Redstone long after their romantic relationship ended, recalls that he periodically would seek refuge on daytime outings, calling to suggest they \u201cgo fishing.\u201d He would meet her for lunch at the Bel Air Hotel in Beverly Hills, then have his driver take them to visit the latest arrivals at the exotic-fish wholesalers he patronized in the San Fernando Valley.<\/p>\n<p>In October 2008, Redstone announced his divorce. A prenuptial agreement reportedly limited Paula\u2019s settlement to $1 million for each year of marriage, but Redstone was more generous than required. In late 2008, he bought her a $4-million home in Beverly Hills and a $2.6-million condominium in Florida. For years to come, he would have his driver deliver dinner to Fortunato\u2019s home every night.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 85, Sumner Redstone was back on the dating scene.<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<ul style=\"display:inline-block;height:100%;margin-bottom:35px;padding:0 10px;line-height:1em;list-style-type:none;\">\n<li style=\"display:block;float:left;height:100%;font-size:.875em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;margin:10px 0 0;padding:0 10px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-2\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read Part II here.<\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"display:block;float:left;height:100%;font-size:.875em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;margin:10px 0 0;padding:0 10px;border-left:3px solid;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-3\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read Part III here.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"May 5, 2016","published":"2016-05-05 04:34:24","updated":"2016-05-05 04:34:24","minute":"4:34 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"The Disturbing Decline of Sumner Redstone (Part 1 of 3)","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/h_8-00050075.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Redstone in 2001, Photograph by Timothy Allen \u2014 eyevine\/Redux","caption":"Sumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom, 2001","attach_id":1648703},"excerpt":"A lurid trial centering on the billionaire\u2019s capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","authors":[{"id":"1645944","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/peter-elkind-with-marty-jones\/","name":"Peter Elkind with Marty Jones","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"A lurid trial centering on the billionaire\u2019s capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","seo":{"seo_title":"The Disturbing Decline of CBS and Viacom's Sumner Redstone","seo_description":"A lurid trial centering on the Sumner Redstone's capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","seo_keywords":"sumner redstone, sumner redstone trial, viacom, cbs, Philippe Dauman, manuela herzer, sydney holland, shari redstone, les moonves, pierce o\u2019donnell","seo_news_keywords":"sumner redstone, sumner redstone trial, viacom, cbs, Philippe Dauman, manuela herzer, sydney holland, shari redstone, les moonves, pierce o\u2019donnell","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sumner-redstone-part-1\/","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2Fsumner-redstone-part-1%2F","shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1pYoASI","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F1pYoASI","encoded_title":"The+Disturbing+Decline+of+Sumner+Redstone+%28Part+1+of+3%29","twitter_text":"The Disturbing Decline of Sumner Redstone (Part 1 of 3)","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"A lurid trial centering on the Sumner Redstone's capacity could determine who controls CBS and Viacom.","facebook_title":"The Disturbing Decline of CBS and Viacom's Sumner Redstone"}},{"id":1630711,"content_type":"free full","is_magazine_content":"magazine","url":"\/donald-trump-businessman\/","title":"Business the Trump Way","content":"<h1 style=\"font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom:35px;text-align:center;line-height:1.5em;color:#ee4123;letter-spacing:.1em;\"><span style=\"font-size:2em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;\">BUSINESS<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:normal;\">THE<\/span> <span style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight:bold;\">TRUMP<\/span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:normal;\">WAY<\/span><\/h1>\n<h2 style=\"font-size:1.125em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;margin:0 35px 17px;line-height:1.3em;color:#0071bb;border-top:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:35px 0;\">He\u2019s a billionaire (though maybe not as rich as he says). He claims he hates debt (but his casino companies went bust \u00adbecause of it). He craves press \u00adattention (but sues at the drop of a hat). What does Trump\u2019s record tell us about how he\u2019ll lead?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Donald Trump\u2019s pitch is simple: He is, as he\u2019ll happily tell you, one of the world\u2019s elite businessmen. Therefore he\u2019d make a great President.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Last June, when Trump famously rode down an escalator inside Trump Tower in Manhattan to announce his presidential candidacy to a crowd padded with paid attendees, he delivered a speech that heavily emphasized his 40-year career as a real estate developer and professional personality. (Although most of the headlines focused on his calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe need a leader who wrote <i>The Art of the Deal,<\/i>\u201d he declared, making sure to mention his bestselling 1987 book. \u201cWe need someone who can take the brand of the U.S. and make it great again!\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then, Trump being Trump, he brandished a financial statement, boasting that he\u2019s worth \u201cwell over $10 billion,\u201d and said that the talent for amassing such wealth is \u201cthe kind of thinking we need for this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Much to the surprise of the political establishment, a good portion of the voting public appears to have bought that argument. Trump has emerged as an unlikely front-runner for the Republican nomination\u2014becoming the first candidate who has never held political office to lead his party\u2019s polls this late in a campaign since lawyer-turned-utility-executive Wendell Willkie challenged F.D.R. in 1940.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">There\u2019s no question that Trump\u2019s perceived business acumen is one of the main drivers of his success. A Bloomberg poll from late last year found that 73% of Republicans think the real estate tycoon \u201cknows how to get things done,\u201d besting all rivals on that measure by a wide margin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But what sort of businessperson is Trump, really? Though he\u2019s been in the public eye for decades, the 69-year-old is arguably better known today for playing an executive on television than for being one in real life. The already famous Trump gained \u00fcber-celebrity status from his starring role as the host of the reality series <i>The Apprentice<\/i> and <i>The Celebrity Apprentice<\/i> for 14 seasons between 2004 and 2015.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read more Fortune coverage of Trump&#8217;s business career:<\/em><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-q-and-a\/\">The Donald Trump Fortune Interview Complete Transcript<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-2\">What Trump Does Have to Teach Leaders<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-atlantic-city-china-sanders\">Donald Trump on Atlantic City, China, and Sanders<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-businessman\">Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know About Trump&#8217;s Business Failures<\/a> (Video)<br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/19\/donald-trump-yellen-fed-debt\">Why Donald Trump Loves Low Interest Rates, But Won&#8217;t Reappoint Janet Yellen<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/trump-sanders-trade\">Why Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Are More Similar Than You Think<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The picture is further obscured by Trump\u2019s obsession with promoting his own mystique and the magic of the Donald Trump brand. That has helped lead him to lend his name to a series of questionable ventures, which have been duly ridiculed, including by the last Republican presidential nominee. \u201cAnd whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University?\u201d said Mitt Romney in a speech excoriating Trump in March. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s <i>Trump Magazine<\/i> and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Whatever you think of Trump, the fact is that he\u2019s shown remarkable resilience in his decades-long career\u2014scraping the depths at times before rising to become richer than he\u2019s ever been. (And then inflating his wealth publicly to make it seem bigger still.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-6\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"6\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">How did Trump amass that fortune? In the end it had little to do with TV paychecks and steak royalties. Rather, it came primarily via the business he grew up in: real estate. A booming market has greatly increased the value of Trump\u2019s key property holdings. He has also profited from an overlooked business in which he thrives\u2014the unglamorous work of overseeing property development and management for other developers. Trump has reaped rich fees in that role on such projects as the current transformation of Washington, D.C.\u2019s historic Old Post Office Building into a luxury hotel, alongside private equity firm Colony Capital. In these ventures, as with his campaign, he keeps his team small and is his own most trusted strategic adviser.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The caricature version of Trump is real. He\u2019s very much the guy who has vowed to force Mexico to pay to build a 50-foot wall on the border. He\u2019s also the man who recently said that women who seek abortions should be subjected to \u201csome form of punishment\u201d\u2014drawing harsh criticism from conservatives and liberals alike. He threw out the idea of a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, then said he would never do it, just threaten it. When he suggested in late March that perhaps Japan should develop nuclear weapons, even unpredictable North Korea was flummoxed\u2014an official called his comments \u201cabsurd and illogical.\u201d And yet the cartoon is not the whole story.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As he marches toward his party\u2019s nomination, the best way to assess how Trump will handle the job of President is to look beyond the daily campaign craziness and closely examine the business career he\u2019s using as his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. (To read what Trump says about his career and his plans for the economy in his own words, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-q-and-a\/\" target=\"_blank\">see our interview here<\/a>.) As the leader of the Free World, how would he lead?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We identified five overriding themes that provide a blueprint for running things the Trump way.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">I.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE ALWAYS COMES FIRST<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630875\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680\" alt=\"Donald Trump at the Grand Opening of Taj Mahal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Trump in 1990 at the opening of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City. He promoted the gambling mecca as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d Later he sold it to his publicly traded company Trump Hotels.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Bettmann\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Over his roller-coaster career, a core part of Trump\u2019s decision-making process can be summarized in four words: Trump always comes first. Whatever the deal, Trump must be the star. He routinely values two things above all, even over making money: being the boss and gaining publicity. No one values the Trump brand higher than Trump himself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The obsession with seeing his name in lights has at times damaged his public shareholders and Trump himself. \u201cHe lives to see his name praised in the press,\u201d says a former associate who has worked closely with Trump. \u201cWhen it comes to choosing between getting more publicity and making good deals, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a tie.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">One notable case in which his ego swamped his judgment occurred in Atlantic City. In mid-1995 he launched a publicly traded holding company, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, which originally owned one casino in the gambling haven, the Trump Plaza, then purchased the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump\u2019s Castle. In the process, Trump Hotels piled on massive debt. (More on that later.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-7\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"7\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By late 1996, Trump Hotels was struggling, but the company was offered a boost. The Rank Group, owner of the Hard Rock chain, proposed an investment in the Castle that would have helped reverse the declining fortunes at Trump Hotels. Rank, which had just opened a Hard Rock Cafe at the Taj, first discussed purchasing a 50% interest in the Castle for as much as $350 million, valuing the property at $180 million more than Trump paid for it. Rank wanted to rebrand the property simply as the Hard Rock. But at the last minute Trump demanded that his name stay on the property and that it be renamed the Hard Rock at Trump\u2019s Marina. Rank walked, and the stock price of Trump Hotels continued to dive. Trump told <i>Fortune<\/i> that he remembers nothing about any negotiations with Rank.<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px dashed #0071bb;margin:0 35px 35px;padding:1em;color:#ee4123;line-height:1.2em;font-size:1.125em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cWhen it comes to choosing between getting more publicity and making good deals, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a tie,\u201d says a former associate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump never likes to sell properties. But he especially hates parting with a building that has his name emblazoned on it. Consider this episode. In 1994, Trump escaped a crippling debt load by selling Riverside South, a huge development site along the Hudson River, to a group from Hong Kong. He managed to keep a 30% stake in the partnership. Over the next decade he oversaw the construction of several Trump-branded apartment towers, with plans for his logo to be spread over a big stretch of western Manhattan. But in 2005 his partners\u2014who had the controlling stake\u2014decided to sell and use the proceeds to purchase two skyscrapers that didn\u2019t carry the Trump name: 1290 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump hated the deal and sued his partners to block it. He argued that the development, bearing the Trump name, was worth about $1 billion more than the price his partners had agreed on. But ironically he later ended up profiting hugely from the transaction. In 2007, Vornado Realty Trust bought out his partners at a price that valued the two buildings at almost $2.6 billion. Trump stayed in the partnership and has seen the value of his stake soar.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">II.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HOW RICH HE IS<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/trump_holdings_010_web.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1630971\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/trump_holdings_010_web.png?w=760&#038;h=721\" alt=\"TRUMP_HOLDINGS_010_WEB\" width=\"760\" height=\"721\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of Trump\u2019s favorite topics is his own net worth, and he\u2019s not satisfied to let the numbers speak for themselves. Much has been made of his statement, under oath in a deposition some years ago, that his own calculation of his wealth changes depending on \u201chow he feels\u201d that day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">One thing that Trump hasn\u2019t felt like doing is release his tax returns, so we can\u2019t know everything about his money. But we have enough information to conclude this: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/02\/donald-trump-tax-returns-income\/?iid=leftrail\" target=\"_blank\">Trump is exaggerating the size of his empire<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On July 15, 2015, Trump filed a personal financial disclosure (PFD) with the Federal Election Commission. The press release that accompanied the disclosure document stated that \u201cas of this date, Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.\u201d (The capitalization is his.) The release also declared that Trump\u2019s income for 2014 was $362 million, \u201cwhich does not include dividends, capital gains, rents, and royalties.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But a close reading of the 92-page document shows that the items that make up that $362 million are actually Trump\u2019s <i>revenues<\/i>, not his income (which would factor in expenses).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That doesn\u2019t imply that Trump is hiding anything, although you would think that a successful businessman would know the difference between revenue and income. Most of the evidence is right there in the filing. But on the basis of his <i>known<\/i> revenues, it\u2019s not plausible that his net worth is $10 billion or more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-8\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"8\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To see why, let\u2019s get into the details. The $362 million figure includes 2014 revenues in 15 buckets\u2014from condo sales to golf \u00adcourses and resorts. The trickiest category is rents, because the information he discloses is incomplete. For smaller properties he reports a range. Let\u2019s grant him the high end, which yields a figure of $46 million. For his bigger buildings, we estimate his total rent at about $130 million a year, based on prevailing rates per square foot. Add up that rent, plus the $362 million, and another $37.5 million in royalties (again, a high-end estimate), and we get a total of $576 million in revenues. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it falls short of a $10 billion enterprise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For perspective, let\u2019s compare Trump\u2019s business to a publicly traded\u2014and therefore transparent\u2014real estate company of roughly the same size. Brandywine Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust that owns more than 179 properties across America, posted revenue of $603 million in 2015\u2014a bit more than our estimate for Trump\u2019s businesses. Today, Brandywine\u2019s market capitalization stands at $2.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>For more on all things Trump, see <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/shawn-tully\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/donald-trump\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Naturally, Trump would argue that the magic of his brand gives him a boost. So let\u2019s assume that Trump\u2019s cachet lifts his operating margins to an industry-best 30%, or well above Brandywine\u2019s 20%. Let\u2019s grant Trump some other generous assumptions\u2014for instance, that he earns a healthy 10% on his $302 million securities portfolio. Factor it all in\u2014and subtract an estimated $40 million a year in interest payments\u2014and <i>Fortune<\/i> ends up with a pretax income estimate of $166 million. If we assume Trump\u2019s businesses are worth 20 times earnings, his empire would be worth about $3.3 billion, or one-third of what he says. (In the chart above, we separately analyzed the values of each of Trump\u2019s holdings and got a higher figure of $3.72 billion. Either way, the total is well short of $10 billion.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump has long used his well-known wealth as a negotiating tool. When creditors threatened to foreclose on him in the early 1990s, Trump claimed his name had such power that taking it off buildings would gravely damage their value. And the tactic worked.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When <i>Fortune<\/i> contacted Trump with our estimate of his wealth, he called to set the record straight. Our income figure is way too low, he insists. \u201cThe $166 mil\u00adlion is peanuts compared to the real number,\u201d says Trump. He says that since he runs a private company, \u201cwe don\u2019t disclose these things,\u201d but that the \u201creal numbers\u201d are four times that big. Boasts the Donald: \u201cWe have 121 licensing deals under negotiation all over the world and the hottest brand anywhere in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump concluded: \u201c<i>Fortune<\/i> has no idea what my assets are or the value of these assets. Nor do they understand or know my cash flow or the many successful transactions that make up my cash flow. <i>Fortune<\/i> has totally lost its way.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">III.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE SUES FIRST, ASKS QUESTIONS LATER<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Trump reads this, will he threaten a lawsuit? It wouldn\u2019t be surprising. In 1984 he sued a <i>Chicago Tribune<\/i> architecture critic for $500 million after the writer criticized Trump\u2019s plan to build a skyscraper in lower Manhattan. (The case was dismissed.) In 2006, Trump sued Tim O\u2019Brien, author of <i>TrumpNation,<\/i> for $5 billion for suggesting that Trump\u2019s net worth was lower than he claimed. (An appeals court later ruled for O\u2019Brien.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s a pattern that goes way back. In 1973, Trump, then 27, moved from Queens, where he grew up, across the East River to the glitz and glory of Manhattan. He joined an exclusive East Side nightclub called Le Club, where he soon met and befriended the notorious lawyer, power broker, and fixer Roy Cohn. A red- and gay-baiter in the 1950s, when he served as chief counsel to Sen. Joseph \u00adMcCarthy, Cohn was famously in-your-face. Cohn was eventually disbarred for fraud and other serious wrongdoing, but not until July 1986, a month before his death, at age 59, from complications of AIDS.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:70%;margin-left:15%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_c.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630876\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_c.jpg?w=900&#038;h=1455\" alt=\"Donald Trump Announces Trump University\" width=\"900\" height=\"1455\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Trump, standing in front of a picture of Trump, shows off a Trump book at the launch of Trump University in May 2005.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Mario Tama\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">When Trump Management ran into trouble in 1973, Trump, then president of the company, turned to Cohn. Trump Management, built by Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump, rented about 14,000 residential units in 39 buildings in Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, according to contemporaneous accounts in the <i>New York Times.<\/i> In October 1973 the government accused the company of discriminating on the basis of race and color in its rental policies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump denied the \u00adcharges, insisting that the government was trying to force his company to rent to welfare recipients. In December 1973, Cohn filed a $100 million counterclaim\u2014a staggering sum in 1973\u2014against the government for defamation. A federal judge struck the counterclaim just five weeks later. In 1975, Trump settled the suit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">However, Cohn\u2019s shocking 1973 counterclaim\u2014a legally far-fetched, media-grabbing shot over the bow announcing that Trump would spare no expense to impose costs on \u00adcritics\u2014provided a template for attacks, which have become a mainstay of Trump\u2019s business arsenal ever since.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-29f2e23199a664ee1b64bdd7bfb338c64b3019e3\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.knightlab.com\/libs\/timeline3\/latest\/embed\/index.html?source=1FiFCu6Z2Em8ObOK24tKzAJuHeogk6jRA9pKu4dKcA8c&#038;font=Default&#038;lang=en&#038;initial_zoom=2&#038;height=800&#038;iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-29f2e23199a664ee1b64bdd7bfb338c64b3019e3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump explained the strategy to journalist William D.

As evidence, he claims that the businesses he runs have \u201cvery low debt and tremendous cash flow.\u201d That example, Trump has declared, demonstrates \u201cthe kind of thinking this country needs, with $19 trillion in debt, believe me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But a close examination of how Trump ran one of America\u2019s biggest gaming enterprises demonstrates an entirely different kind of thinking from the belt-tightening rhetoric he spouts on the campaign trail. In fact, Trump has a record of recklessly piling on debt\u2014with disastrous results.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump served as chairman and sometimes CEO of publicly traded Trump Hotels, later renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 to its second bankruptcy, in early 2009. Over that period he leveraged his gaming properties to such heights that he gravely impaired their prospects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When Trump Hotels first went public in 1995, its big holding was a single casino: the Trump Plaza. Early the following year, Trump Hotels bought the Trump Taj Mahal, billed as the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World,\u201d for $898 million. In the transaction, Trump Hotels took on a lot of really expensive debt\u2014$817 million in junk bond borrowings at 11.25% interest. From the start, the Taj was losing \u00admoney because of its big interest burden. \u201cPeople will be shocked when they hear the numbers. The numbers are just huge,\u201d said Trump at the time, hyping the merger.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_d.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630877\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_d.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=634\" alt=\"Nordaby and Demidio, of Calvi Electric, remove the letter 'A' from the signage of Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey\" width=\"1024\" height=\"634\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Workers remove letters from a sign on Atlantic City\u2019s Trump Plaza Casino shortly after it shut down in 2014.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Mark Makela\u2014Reuters<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump wasn\u2019t done buying casinos\u2014from Trump. In June 1996 he announced the purchase of another of his casinos, Trump\u2019s Castle. Whereas he\u2019d held just half the equity in the Taj, he owned 100% of the Castle. Trump Hotels agreed to buy the Castle for about $520 million\u2014and Trump gave himself a premium. The announced price was a staggering 18 times cash flow (twice what the Taj had fetched). It\u2019s not even clear the Castle was worth its debt load of over $350 million.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It didn\u2019t take long for the debt to take its toll. When Trump Hotels went public, it had carried just $494 million in long-term debt; by the end of the next year, after the two big purchases, its borrowings had ballooned to $1.7 billion. By 2002, Trump Hotels\u2019 debt was $2.1 billion, and its leverage ratio had expanded to 27, approaching the levels that sank Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">From its IPO in 1995 through two separate bankruptcies in 2004 and 2009, Trump Hotels\u2014and its successor, Trump Entertainment\u2014never made money. Year after year its operating profits were decimated by gigantic interest costs. Over the almost 15 years that Trump served as chairman, the casino company posted net losses, excluding extraordinary items, totaling nearly $1.7 billion.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">V.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE THINKS HE&#8217;S GREAT AT EVERYTHING<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike most real estate titans, Trump has never stuck to real estate. He has frequently attempted to acquire and operate companies in industries outside his expertise. Several executives who worked for Trump, all of whom declined to speak on the record because they fear his wrath, say they were constantly warned by managers who knew him best that \u201cDonald\u2019s ego is so big, he believes he can run anything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-10\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"10\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the late 1980s, Trump bought the Plaza Hotel and the former Eastern Shuttle (renaming it Trump Shuttle), then lost both businesses to excessive debt and weak management. He also led abortive takeovers of Bally and American Airlines. His buccaneering style was especially misplaced in gambling, an industry that\u2019s extremely cyclical. While his rival Steve Wynn stuck to gaming and retrenched when he anticipated downturns, Trump never thought Atlantic City would do anything but boom\u2014failing to foresee the threat from the spread of gaming to neighboring states.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The same approach is evident in Trump\u2019s latest quest in politics. He clearly thinks he\u2019s not just the best candidate for the job but also the best at running a major presidential campaign. \u201cI\u2019m the strategist,\u201d he recently bragged to <i>New York<\/i> magazine, explaining that he has been the architect of his unorthodox campaign and unexpected political success. Once again, though, Trump might not know quite as much as he thinks he does. Pundits are predicting that his ineptitude in the intricacies of the process\u2014especially in securing delegates\u2014could potentially cost him the nomination at the Republican convention. Then Trump could go back to the business of being Trump full-time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"April 21, 2016","published":"2016-04-21 06:30:43","updated":"2016-04-21 06:30:43","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"Business the Trump Way","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_a.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Above photo by Gillian Laub\u2014Contour by Getty Images","caption":"Businessman Donald Trump is photographed in his office","attach_id":1630874},"excerpt":"What does his record say about how he\u2019ll lead?","authors":[{"id":"1630741","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/shawn-tully-and-roger-parloff\/","name":"Shawn Tully and Roger Parloff","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"What does his record say about how he\u2019ll lead?","seo":{"seo_title":"Business the Donald Trump Way","seo_description":"What does Donald Trump's business record say about how he\u2019ll lead the United States?","seo_keywords":"donald trump, election 2016, donald trump net worth, trump hotels, donald trump businesses, donald trump career, donald trump lawsuits, trump presidential campaign, trump businessman","seo_news_keywords":"donald trump, election 2016, donald trump net worth, trump hotels, donald trump businesses, donald trump career, donald trump lawsuits, trump presidential campaign, trump businessman","seo_additional_meta":"<meta name=\"standout\" content=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\" \/>"},"social":{"url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2Fdonald-trump-businessman%2F","shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/20Xomsz","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F20Xomsz","encoded_title":"Business+the+Trump+Way","twitter_text":"Business the Trump way","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"What does his record say about how he\u2019ll lead?","facebook_title":"Business the Trump Way"}},{"id":1628204,"content_type":"free full","is_magazine_content":"magazine","url":"\/no-labels-campaign\/","title":"Here's How the Next President Can Fix the Economy: No Labels","content":"<h2 style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:52px;margin-left:10px;line-height:1.3em;\"><em>The presidential campaign has been long on conflict and short on serious policy proposals. But a candidate who got behind a thoughtful, bipartisan policy agenda could get a lot done in the White House.<\/em><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">In just six months Amer\u00adica will elect a new President, and our nation isn\u2019t even close to having a debate that meets the gravity of this moment. Of the many serious questions going unanswered by our candidates, the most important one is, How?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>How would you, as President, bring our country together around a common vision for where we need to go and how we get there?<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Without a good answer to this question\u2014and we have yet to hear one\u2014candidates are selling little more than a fantasy, a wish list of things they would do if they were king or queen for a day. But America doesn\u2019t do monarchy, and we can\u2019t afford any more wishful thinking. What we need from our aspiring political leaders is recognition of two stark realities.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The first is that neither party is likely to have enough power to get everything it wants anytime soon. For the foreseeable future, Democrats and Republicans in Washington will have to find a way to work together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If they don\u2019t, they and the country will fail together, because the second reality is that America is running out of time. For the past few years we have benefited from an unearned dividend. Global investors poured money into our currency and companies, not because the U.S. looked so great, but because the rest of the world looked so bad. This won\u2019t last forever. America\u2019s problems\u2014\u00adranging from growing debt to incomprehensible tax and regulatory systems\u2014are deadly serious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Though America navigated the post-2008 global financial crisis era better than many nations, our stagnant employment market is a sign of our enduring problems. There are still millions of people who are out of work, working part-time when they\u2019d rather be full-time, taking low-paying jobs for which they\u2019re overqualified, or giving up looking for work altogether.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1628204-11\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"11\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the root of our problems is the refusal of our political leaders to seek common ground. Our next President\u2019s most important task is to bridge this divide, with a real plan to bring the parties and the nation together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">No Labels\u2014the growing movement of Democrats, Republicans, and independents that we lead\u2014has such a plan. On April 21 we released the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda\/\" target=\"_blank\">No Labels Policy Playbook for America\u2019s Next President<\/a>, an ambitious blueprint for bipartisan problem solving.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Over the past two years <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolabels.org\/ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\">No Labels has developed an agenda<\/a> that represents both good politics and good policy. Through nationwide polling and workshops with policy experts from across the political spectrum, we sought to identify America\u2019s most pressing challenges and develop policies that make sense, that our country can afford, and that the American people can support.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The result is a playbook of 60 concrete ideas designed to progress toward the four goals of our National Strategic Agenda. We aim to create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, secure Social Security and Medicare for the next 75 years, balance the federal budget by 2030, and make America energy-secure by 2024. The vast majority of ideas in the playbook\u2014\u00adcovering areas including taxes, the federal budget, entitlements, infrastructure, immigration, energy, regulation, and education\u2014garnered between 60% and 80% support in our polls.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/big-05-01-16-chart.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1631208\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/big-05-01-16-chart.png?w=545&#038;h=440\" alt=\"BIG.05.01.16.chart\" width=\"545\" height=\"440\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">For more, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda\/\" target=\"_blank\">fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolabels.org\/ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\">nolabels.org\/ideas<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Few of America\u2019s problems are simple, so we attacked them from multiple angles. Take, for example, America\u2019s startup crisis. Entrepreneurship is America\u2019s economic engine, with startup companies responsible for nearly all net job growth. But for the first time in modern history, more startups are dying than being born.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So we tried to figure out why. We found that small businesses are hit particularly hard by regulatory compliance, with regulations costing them over $10,000 per employee, 36% higher than the cost to larger businesses. We learned that most small businesses spend 40 hours or more annually preparing their federal taxes. And we found that access to capital remains a huge challenge, especially for minority-\u00adowned businesses, which have loan denial rates three times as high as those of non-minority-owned firms.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In our playbook, we offer real, workable solutions. We propose a sunset and reconsideration of all federal regulations after 15 years and the creation of a regulatory \u201croad map\u201d that enables entrepreneurs to view in one place all the federal, state, and local regulations that may affect their business. We recommend a radical simplification of both the corporate and individual tax codes. We also suggest reimagining the Community Reinvestment Act\u2014which provides incentives for banks to lend to people in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods\u2014to allow more funding to be funneled to startups.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Of course, just because a policy agenda polls well doesn\u2019t mean that the toughest fights\u2014about how much or whom to tax or about the proper role of government\u2014will suddenly be resolved. But our research shows that America is not as hopelessly divided as cynics and ideologues might have us believe. In fact, there are many credible ideas that address voters\u2019 most significant concerns and appeal to a broad swath of Democrats, Republicans, and independents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1628204-12\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"12\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The ideas in our playbook are designed to jump-start a long-overdue debate on the issues that really matter. It\u2019s on us, the American people, to demand that debate. No Labels will do its part, growing our million-plus-member citizen army and empowering a \u201cproblem-solver caucus\u201d in Congress that now numbers almost 80 members.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We have no doubt about America\u2019s ability to thrive in the 21st century. Americans are just as entrepreneurial, hardworking, and resourceful as we\u2019ve always been. We can outcompete and outwork our global competitors every day of the week.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The problem is a government that can\u2019t seem to get to yes on even the simplest issues. And make no mistake: Washington\u2019s dysfunction is directly harming the health, wealth, and well-being of American families.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It is time for America\u2019s leaders to fix, not fight.

At Caf\u00e9 des Amis on Union Street in San Francisco, Parker and legendary angel investor Ron Conway\u2014both part owners of the place\u2014were sitting across from each other at a crowded banquette at what amounted to a family dinner. Ron\u2019s wife, Gayle, was next to him; Alexandra Lenas, Parker\u2019s new girlfriend and future wife, was curled up beside him. Still, the crowd was boisterous, and it was so loud that Parker had to shout to be heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI\u2019m going to cure cancer!\u201d he yelled.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The outburst was vintage Sean. \u201cWe\u2019d both had plenty of wine,\u201d remembers Conway, who has known Parker, now 36, since he was an \u201cedgy\u201d 19-year-old\u2014a daredevil hacker from Herndon, Va., whose music file-sharing company would almost single-handedly humble the recording industry. Conway, now 65, had mentored Parker through nearly every company he had helped start or lead\u2014Napster; Plaxo, an automated address book that had made clever, if infuriating, use of viral marketing; and of course Facebook, the college-dorm-project-turned-juggernaut that had made Parker truly rich. (When the company went public in May 2012, Parker\u2019s 66 million shares turned him into an instant paper billionaire. Sources close to him say that he\u2019s currently worth between $2 billion and $3 billion.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Conway had seen Parker\u2019s eyes go moonlike before; he had seen him dance from one \u201cworld-changing\u201d project to the next. But something about this declaration on this night felt different: \u201cHe looked me in the eye and said it again: \u2018I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life curing cancer. There are not going to be any more Lauras in the world.\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-13\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"13\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cLaura\u201d was Laura Ziskin, a petite, radiantly effusive woman who had produced the blockbuster Spider-Man franchise, <i>Pretty Woman,<\/i> and dozens of other movies and who had co-founded the Stand Up to Cancer movement. In the short time since Parker had met her, at a 2009 retreat on philanthropy in Tuscany, they had become exceptionally close. And when Ziskin\u2019s breast cancer had reemerged with brutal efficiency after a long remission, Parker had managed to get her into a last-ditch immunotherapy protocol at the Hutch, the famed Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle\u2014chartering private planes at his own expense to shepherd her back and forth from Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cMost of the dinner conversation at Caf\u00e9 des Amis that evening was about Laura\u2019s cancer,\u201d Conway recalls, \u201cand why they had to try everything possible to save her.\u201d Parker was deeply affected. Conway had no doubt about that. After dinner, as the party \u00adheaded for home, the valet took the older man\u2019s ticket and turned to get his car. \u201cI said, \u2018No, no, no, no!

But sub in the more Parkeresque verb \u201chack\u201d for \u201ccure,\u201d and the claim no longer seems far-fetched: Sean Parker is going to hack cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Well, yes\u2014he is.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">A hack, the way Parker defines it, is \u201ca clever work-around or a clever way of leveraging an existing system to do something you didn\u2019t think it was going to be able to do.\u201d By that definition, just about every memorable entry on Parker\u2019s steadily growing curriculum vitae, from Napster and Facebook to current projects like music-streaming company Spotify and in-home movie service The Screening Room, counts as a hack. Why wouldn\u2019t medical \u00adresearch\u2014one of the most labyrinthine, bureaucratized, and slow moving of all important human endeavors\u2014be ripe for a creative work-around of its own?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>For more on the intersection of technology and health, check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/digital-health\/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Health page<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In mid-April\u2014in an over-the-top, celebrity-gawking, Lady Gaga\u2013serenading event that brought 900 people in black tie to his 2\u00bd-acre backyard in L.A.\u2019s Holmby Hills neighborhood\u2014Parker announced a $250 million cancer research hack that he\u2019d been working on quietly, diligently, for three years: the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. PICI (pronounced \u201cpie-sea\u201d), as it\u2019s called by its member scientists, is doing something unprecedented in academic medicine: combining and coordinating the efforts of six of the top cancer immunology centers in the country\u2014MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Penn Medicine, Stanford, UCLA, and UCSF\u2014in order to greatly expand and, more important, to accelerate our understanding of why some immune-based treatments work miraculously in some patients and not at all in others. Carl June, an oncologist at Penn and a PICI team member, says he almost can\u2019t believe Parker pulled it off. \u201cNever before would I think you could get all these institutions to sign the exact same document,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-18c05da2184a8c3a79420e6fed359032272d511a\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"http:\/\/archive.fortune.com\/2016\/sean-parker-timeline\/index.html?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-18c05da2184a8c3a79420e6fed359032272d511a\" width=\"100%\" height=\"230px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">With a critical mass of 450,000 patients annually among them, the six centers have agreed to combine their efforts on planning clinical trials in immunotherapy, recruit patients quickly, and share the information learned\u2014which could be the single biggest factor in speeding up drug development. They\u2019ll set up common platforms and standards for sharing and storing data. And perhaps most meaningful of all, PICI will manage all the intellectual property\u2014the discoveries, new drugs, new tools, new technologies\u2014that come out of the six member groups, splitting any revenue generated from this IP between the institute and the sites.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cCentrally managing the IP is an important break from the way that things are traditionally done,\u201d says Jedd Wolchok, a medical oncologist and the director of the PICI center at Memorial Sloan Kettering. \u201cBut even bigger is that the royalties and licensing go into a collective communal fund, if you will, that is redistributed to the individual scientists. So essentially, if the [Parker] experiment works, this becomes a self-perpetuating entity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It may all sound like more of a logical next step than a revolution\u2014until you come to understand, as Parker has, just how fragmented the cancer-research community has become. Lack of money isn\u2019t the main problem. There\u2019s much in what Parker calls our \u201cdysfunctional human systems\u201d that is getting in the way of anti\u00adcancer efforts throughout academia, government, and industry: the zeal for secrecy among competitors that prevents the quick sharing of ideas, tools, and platforms; the frenzy of grant applications and publication that keeps brilliant scientists from their real work; the inherent caution, baked into the regulatory system and medical culture itself, that slows the testing of promising ideas in clinical trials.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-14\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"14\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">There have to be hacks for these too, Parker thinks. By now we\u2019ve been talking in his luminous, book-strewn office in his Holmby Hills house for nearly two hours. Every few minutes he clears his throat, as though he needs to catch his breath. \u201cBetween the pure science in an academic model, in the ivory tower, so to speak, and the ultra-\u00adcutthroat laser focus of a biotech, we have to somehow bridge those two worlds in order to get [therapies] to patients\u201d faster, Parker says. In his dark sweater and pants and red beard, he looks a bit like a beat poet. But a moment later, when he\u2019s describing his own function in PICI, he\u2019s back to being a venture capitalist. His role? \u201cTo program the organization to pursue commercialization of therapies.\u201d If it works, Parker notes, PICI could be a force for cancer research for decades to come. \u201cBut that depends on us having hits,\u201d he says. \u201cI sound like a record executive now: We\u2019ve gotta have hits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For now, PICI is bringing disparate scientists to the table with funding that\u2019s gargantuan by academic-research standards. Every hospital \u201cgets a big chunk of money upfront\u2014between $20 million and $35 million, depending on the institution,\u201d says Jeff Bluestone, a UCSF scientist who\u2019s now the Parker Institute\u2019s president and CEO. Each can use it to study pretty much what\u00adever he or she wants, so long as it fits PICI\u2019s strategic road map\u2014and so long as it involves cancer immunotherapy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_m.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630953\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_m.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Tech Entrepeneur Sean Parker (left) talks to Jeff Bluestone (center), CEO and president of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, during a retreatat the Meadowood resort in St. Helena, CA.Photo by Winni Wintermeyer for Fortune.

Parker has become known for his deep dives into cancer research.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Winni Wintermeyer for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Immunotherapy differs<\/span> from more traditional cancer treatments, such as surgery (cutting malignant cells out of the body), chemotherapy and radiation (poisoning the deadly mutants), and even the newer, more precise molecular drugs that attempt to jam the protein signals that tell tumor cells to keep dividing and conquering. Most immunotherapy strategies don\u2019t take aim at cancer cells directly; rather, they rev up the immune system to be more aggressive in its interdiction, or they help it zero in on malignant cells more efficiently, or they silence the \u201cstand down\u201d messages the body sends to T cells, the immune system\u2019s natural-born assassins, so that the cells can continue to seek out and kill their targets. The name given to this last strategy fits the Jason Bourne\u2013like plotline underlying the biology: \u201ccheckpoint inhibition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Immunotherapy, in short, helps the body do the dirty work of defending itself against homegrown terrorists. And the approach, say a growing number of cancer experts, is both radically intuitive and radically promising. There are more than 80 immune-related cancer therapies currently in clinical trials, fueled by many billions of dollars in pharmaceutical investment from the likes of Bristol-Myers Squibb <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"bmy\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bristol-myers-squibb-195\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">bmy<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Merck <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"mrk\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/merck-71\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">mrk<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Pfizer <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"pfe\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/pfizer-56\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">pfe<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and dozens of biotechs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sharon Belvin is one of the miracles\u2014the kind of story that \u00adfuels the immunotherapy dream and has even long-term skeptics shaking their heads with wonder. Belvin was 22 years old in 2004 when she discovered a lump beneath her left collarbone\u2014which turned out to be an outgrowth of a tumor in her lung. The New Jersey grad student had Stage 4 melanoma, a disease for which the five-year survival rate was just 17% (meaning five out of six patients die within five years of diagnosis).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Belvin was given heavy doses of chemotherapy\u2014in 2004 that was almost all there was to offer. Her first IV infusions came in a toxic sweep on a Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. She got married that Saturday. \u201cWe had guest invites out to everybody\u2014we had been planning this for a year and a half,\u201d she says. Instead of the wedding dress she had picked out, she wore a white suit to cover the Port-a-Cath and tubes sticking out of her body. The cancer soon spread to her brain. Her chest cavity filled with 12 liters of fluid. Her body was breaking down. She couldn\u2019t breathe.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-15\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"15\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When Wolchok, Belvin\u2019s oncologist at Sloan Kettering, offered her the opportunity to participate in an immunotherapy clinical trial, she jumped at the chance. The trial involved an experimental checkpoint inhibitor from Bristol-Myers Squibb called ipilimumab (now marketed as Yervoy)\u2014whose aim was to release the molecular brakes on her own army of T cells. She got one 90-minute infusion every three to four weeks; four treatments in all. That was it. The cancer never came back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The never-coming-back part of the story is a critical element of this strategy\u2019s appeal. <span class=\"s2\">Our immune system has a great memory. In treatment of melanoma, for example, a significant percentage of patients who enter full remission with immunotherapy remain there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It is easy, of course, to get breathless about such uplifting tales. But the cancer immunotherapy saga is a long one, fraught with a century\u2019s worth of hype and disappointment. <i>Time<\/i> magazine put an immune-boosting protein called interferon on its cover in 1980; <i>Fortune<\/i> did the same in 1985 with another immune protein called interleukin-2, hailing it as a \u201cCancer Breakthrough.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t, at least for most patients in most situations.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That said, there is a growing sense among many cancer experts that immunotherapy could improve by leaps and bounds if the right mysteries are unlocked. The status quo for hundreds of thousands of people, meanwhile, is untenable: More than 333,000 Americans will be diagnosed this year in any of four cancer types in which the five-year survival rate remains lower than 20%, and in all, nearly 600,000 U.S. deaths are expected from cancer in 2016.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea-05-01-16-sean_parker_collaboration_rules.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1632483\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea-05-01-16-sean_parker_collaboration_rules.png?w=780&#038;h=375\" alt=\"HEA.05.01.16.sean_parker_collaboration_rules\" width=\"780\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the current <\/span><span class=\"s2\">phase of the war on cancer, the nation is in the midst of a hackapalooza. Or maybe \u201cspace race\u201d is more apt. President Obama\u2019s National Cancer Moonshot Initiative, announced in January\u2019s State of the Union, follows Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s Cancer MoonShot 2020, which joins MD Anderson\u2019s Moon Shots Program on an already crowded launchpad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Just two weeks or so before PICI\u2019s debut, Johns Hopkins opened its own institute for cancer immunotherapy, with a $125 million gift from donors, including billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Sidney Kimmel. That, in turn, followed ambitious cancer efforts over the years by Michael Milken and the late Andy Grove, among others (<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/22\/business-disrupting-medicine-kathy-giusti-bill-gates-michael-milken\/\" target=\"_blank\">read more here<\/a>).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">All of which raises the legitimate question of whether Parker\u2019s new endeavor is worth getting Lady Gaga over. The answer lies partly in PICI\u2019s collaboration model\u2014and partly in Parker, who has immersed himself in cancer science in the way that few of his fellow philanthropists can match, according to some of the most prominent people in the field, inside PICI and out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cHere is a guy who\u2019s just like, wow, he gets it,\u201d says virologist Larry Corey, president and director emeritus at the Hutch. \u201cHe asks \u00adreally great questions that lead to things. And he\u2019ll stop for a minute and think. Then all of a sudden\u2014<i>bam!<\/i>\u2014out comes this great idea.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Long before his fascination with cancer, Parker was drawn to the study of the immune system by his own profoundly serious food allergies. He takes corticosteroids and carries Benadryl and an EpiPen for emergencies, but he has still ended up in the ER a number of times. Autoimmune disorders run in his family: His mom suffers from Hashimoto\u2019s disease, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">His family history is part of the connect-the-dots Parker plays without end, reading late into the night, swimming in medical papers, diving into conversations with researchers of any stripe\u2014discussing malarial vectors with Sir Richard Feachem at UCSF and checkpoint inhibitors with Jim Allison, a groundbreaking immunotherapy researcher at MD Anderson in Houston. \u201cThe first time I met him, we talked for about an hour,\u201d recalls Allison. \u201cAfter that I actually went to San Francisco and met him at a hotel, and we talked for about three hours. I was amazed. He operates at the level of a really well-trained graduate student\u2014if not better.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:70%;margin-left:15%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1631446\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_l.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1277\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1277\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Parker in his Los Angeles home, April 7, 2016<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Joe Pugliese for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s a kind of seriousness belied by the lighter, harder-partying side of Parker\u2019s personality. That image was cemented in the public mind, and in a not-so-positive light, by David Fincher\u2019s movie <i>The Social Network,<\/i> in which Parker was played by Justin Timberlake as a self-serving, callous playboy. (Parker calls the depiction a \u201ccaricature,\u201d and in 24 interviews for this story, I couldn\u2019t find a single person who thinks of Parker that way or who could identify anyone who did.) Still, the Hollywood version wasn\u2019t entirely fiction. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"crm\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/salesforce-com-483\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">crm<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, remembers meeting Parker years ago\u2014\u201cin his single days,\u201d Benioff adds\u2014when Parker was being profiled by another magazine. \u201cHe had a bottle of Maker\u2019s Mark in his right hand that he proceeded to finish during the interview,\u201d Benioff recalls. But then \u201cSean would also say these amazingly prophetic and visionary, insightful, brilliant things, and he has been quite prescient in thinking about some big trends.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the cancer fight, Parker\u2019s brainpower is harnessed to a personal passion that anyone who\u2019s lost a loved one to the disease can understand\u2014the kind of passion that exerts its own gravitational pull. Even cancer doctors aren\u2019t immune. Cassian Yee, an MD Anderson oncologist, recalls meeting Parker in September 2010. The doctor, who was then at the Hutch, had flown to Los Angeles from Seattle in the afternoon, and had waited an hour for Parker in the lobby of the swank Peninsula Hotel, where the young entrepreneur had been holed up for weeks in the wake of knee surgery\u2014residing with a pair of finches that were flying about in his suite. (Someone had given them to Parker as a gift.) Then Yee and Parker, a pair of crutches by his side, took a limo to a Sony Pictures <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"sne\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sne\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">sne<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> studio in Culver City, where a televised fundraiser, <i>Stand Up to Cancer, <\/i>was being recorded that evening.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Backstage, Parker introduced Yee to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and to Elizabeth Edwards\u2014the wife of Sen. John Edwards\u2014who had Stage 4 breast cancer and was donning a chic wig for the evening. (\u201cDo you like my new do?\u201d she asked.) Then he called over the show\u2019s producer, Laura Ziskin\u2014the friend whose breast cancer had returned with a vengeance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-16\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"16\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWe want you to treat her with immunotherapy,\u201d said Parker. Yee had been practicing oncology at the Hutch with this general approach for several years. He was a believer. But there were rules\u2014the Food and Drug Administration had to sign off on each protocol, as did the Hutch\u2019s own Institutional Review Board. \u201cI can only treat melanoma patients right now,\u201d he objected. \u201cI don\u2019t have approval.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWe\u2019ll send you to an island,\u201d Parker \u00adoffered\u2014somewhere outside American jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">After a bit more prodding, Yee agreed to apply to the FDA for a single-patient, or \u201ccompassionate use,\u201d exemption to the agency\u2019s strict rules on testing investigational new drugs. (He got the approval.) Weeks later, Yee realized that he didn\u2019t have the equipment he needed to pluck out of Ziskin\u2019s blood the rare (perhaps one in 100,000) T cells that could identify the subtle peptide markers on the surface of her cancer cells and attack the disease. The doctor sent a note to Ziskin explaining the delay and apologizing. The following week, two checks from Parker, totaling $600,000, arrived at the lab. \u201cFor: laser cell sorter,\u201d the note said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Parker was resourceful, but ultimately mortality triumphed over medicine. Ziskin died in June 2011. At the next <i>Stand Up to Cancer<\/i> benefit program, Parker delivered her eulogy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_e.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630955\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_e.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Parker (center, in blue sweater) has built relationships among competing scientists at PICI retreats like this one in St. Helena, Calif.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Winni Wintermeyer for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m trying to<\/span> fig<span class=\"s2\">ure out a way to say this,\u201d starts entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who was Facebook\u2019s first big investor, thanks largely to Parker, and who later brought on Parker at his VC firm, Founders Fund. In both technology and science, there are those who generate ideas and those who disseminate them, he explains. \u201cAnd Sean is really good at both. We tend to think of there being some sort of tradeoff,\u201d but in fact the skills are \u201cdeeply complementary.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The reason his cancer initiative has such potential when others have failed is that Parker has both the vision and the ability to articulate it, says Thiel. And there\u2019s another factor that will drive this forward, says Parker\u2019s friend Benioff, of Salesforce. It comes down to the word \u201cWhy?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cSean doesn\u2019t have a traditional motivational cause,\u201d says \u00adBenioff. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing this to be wealthy or to be known or to be significant.

Then the world\u2019s biggest food and beverage company stumbled into a public relations debacle that cost it half a billion dollars. A cautionary tale of mangled crisis management on an epic scale.<\/em><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was the middle of the night when the jangle of his cellphone woke Sanjay Khajuria from a deep sleep. In the few seconds it took him to get his bearings\u2014to remember he was in a Manhattan hotel room and not at home in his bed in Delhi\u2014the Nestl\u00e9 executive had an unsettling thought: Could this be about Maggi?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria is not accustomed to receiving urgent, late-night phone calls. As head of corporate affairs for Nestl\u00e9 India, he typically divides his time between handling routine regulatory issues and trumpeting the company\u2019s achievements in \u201ccreating shared value\u201d\u2014the approach to corporate social responsibility that Nestl\u00e9 espouses. In fact, Khajuria, 51, was in New York to represent his company in a shared value leadership summit, for which Nestl\u00e9 was a sponsor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Virtually everything in his world had appeared to be in order when he boarded his flight to New York. There was just one pesky issue to clear up. Health officials in one of India\u2019s 29 states had raised questions after testing a sample of one of Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s bestselling products: Maggi 2-Minute Noodles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food and beverage company, has sold Maggi (pronounced \u201cMAG-ee\u201d) in India for more than 30 years, and the brand\u2019s ubiquity and cultural resonance on the subcontinent is something akin to Coca-Cola\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ko\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola-63\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ko<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> in the U.S. \u2009In 2014, Indians consumed more than 400,000 tons of the instant noodles\u2014marketed in 10 varieties, from Thrillin\u2019 Curry to Cuppa Mania Masala Yo!\u2014and Maggi accounted for roughly a quarter of the company\u2019s $1.6 billion in revenue in the country. That year Maggi was named one of India\u2019s five most trusted brands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/sanjay-khajuria.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636113\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/sanjay-khajuria.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Sanjay Khajuria stands at the Maggi display in Nestle's Indian headquarters in Gurgaon.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Sanjay Khajuria stands near the Maggi display in Nestl\u00e9 India&#8217;s headquarters in Gurgaon. <\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria\u2019s team had received the regulatory notice about Maggi 10 days earlier. The food-safety commissioner of Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, with 205 million people, was claiming that a package of the noodles had been found to contain seven times the permissible level of lead and had recalled the batch. Nestl\u00e9 India had quickly responded with test results of its own showing that its noodles were absolutely safe. Khajuria expected that officials would find his company\u2019s response compelling and that the issue would soon be resolved. But why was someone trying to reach him at such a late hour?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He reached for his phone and answered the call. It wasn\u2019t good news. Khajuria\u2019s colleagues back at home informed him that a widely read Hindi language newspaper had reported the news about the health notice. More alarming: The article suggested that state officials would soon recommend that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the country\u2019s central regulator, should ban Maggi nationwide.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria spent the next hour on the phone formulating a game plan. Nestl\u00e9 would respond to media requests but not yet issue a public statement. And it would send a three-person delegation to meet directly with the health officials in Uttar Pradesh the following day. At this point, allows Khajuria, he was starting to get worried.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-17\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"17\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When he hung up, he couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. It was May 11, 2015.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">What had at first seemed like a minor regulatory annoyance was about to spiral into a crisis of epic proportions for Nestl\u00e9. Within a week the first national news story about a Maggi health scare appeared in the <i>Times of India<\/i>. A couple of days later the hashtag #MaggiBan surfaced on Twitter. Then things got worse.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On June 5, 2015, less than a month after Khajuria\u2019s phone rang in the middle of the night, India\u2019s central food regulator announced a temporary ban on the manufacture, sale, and distribution of Maggi noodles. In its order the FSSAI pronounced Maggi \u201cunsafe and hazardous for human consumption,\u201d a designation supported by 30 government lab tests showing Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles contained excess amounts of lead.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_e.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634609\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_e.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=673\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles are often served by vendors at \u201cMaggi points.\u201d<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Kuni Takahashi\u2014Bloomberg via Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Enraged consumers wasted no time venting their anger. In some cities protesters in the street smashed and set fire to packs of noodles and photos of Bollywood stars who were paid Maggi endorsers. One prominent newscaster compared the situation to Bhopal, the worst industrial accident of all time, in which a toxic gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in central India killed thousands of people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Maggi meltdown would prove costly. Nestl\u00e9 lost at least $277 million in missed sales. Another $70 million was spent to execute one of the largest food recalls in history. Add the damage to its brand value\u2014which one consultancy pegged at $200 million\u2014and the total price tag for the debacle could easily be more than half a billion dollars. And the fallout continues.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-print-charts.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636858\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-print-charts.png?w=760&#038;h=365\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.print-charts\" width=\"760\" height=\"365\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nearly a year after the ban, Maggi noodles are back on shelves in India, but somewhat precariously so. The product\u2019s future depends on two legal cases that are working their way through the Indian court system. Both pit Nestl\u00e9 against the Indian government.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9, meanwhile, is still struggling to make sense of what exactly transpired. To counter the accusations of Indian health officials, Nestl\u00e9 has produced voluminous tests\u2014on more than 3,500 samples\u2014that it says show its instant noodles are perfectly safe, with lead counts well below the legal limit. For a 150-year-old Swiss business that brands itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s leading nutrition, health, and wellness company,\u201d the idea that it fell short on quality control\u2014especially regarding a substance with such dire health effects\u2014is anathema. But where, then, did things go so terribly wrong?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-map.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636633\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-map.png?w=760&#038;h=870\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.map\" width=\"760\" height=\"870\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-photosplit.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636857\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-photosplit.png?w=760&#038;h=182\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.photosplit\" width=\"760\" height=\"182\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This is a story about precisely that: What happens when a $100 billion global giant suddenly finds itself in a crisis\u2014and everything it does to get out of it only sinks the company further into the morass? It\u2019s an epic narrative of a powerful corporation brought low by an obscure food-safety agency in India and a handful of local government functionaries. And it\u2019s a case study in irony about a company that, after a humiliating and existential scandal over infant formula, tried to reinvent itself as a paragon of corporate do-gooding and transparency\u2014only to discover that no matter what positive, world-bettering things it did, it couldn\u2019t quite escape its tainted past.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s also a cautionary tale about a towering multinational utterly losing its way in one of the world\u2019s most sought-after markets\u2014India\u2014which, as it happens, has chewed up and spit out a number of mighty names in the past. Coca-Cola left the country in 1977 after being asked to hand over its secret formula\u2014only to return decades later and get banned again, briefly, when pesticides were found in its soda. Walmart <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"wmt\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart-1\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">wmt<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> scaled back its ambitious plans in India in 2013 when it realized it couldn\u2019t possibly comply with regulations requiring 30% of its products to be sourced from small Indian businesses. Just recently Facebook tasted its own frustration when, in February, Indian regulators rejected its Free Basics web access program. This is the regulatory thicket that pro-business Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to untangle\u2014and that still seems as impenetrable as ever.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_f.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634611\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_f.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=751\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"751\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">In June 2015, after reports of lead contamination, outraged consumers set fire to packs of Maggi.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: EPA\/Corbis<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Despite Nestl\u00e9\u2019s long history in India, the company\u2019s executives managed to misread a fast-moving situation at every point. And in that sense the Maggi episode is certain to be studied by MBA students and public relations executives looking for lessons for years to come.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThis is a case where you can be so right and yet so wrong,\u201d says Nestl\u00e9 CEO Paul Bulcke. \u201cWe were right on factual arguments and yet so wrong on arguing. It\u2019s not a matter of being right. It\u2019s a matter of engaging the right way and finding a solution.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe live in an ambiguous world. We have to be able to cope with that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To understand why Nestl\u00e9 failed so spectacularly in this instance, it helps to go back to where the saga started.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">A Surprising Test Result<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Sanjay Singh bent down and plucked a four-pack of masala-flavored Maggi noodles from a low shelf at Easyday, a well-maintained mini-mart on the western edge of Barabanki. It was a Monday morning in March 2014. As one of five food inspectors in Barabanki, a rough-and-tumble town of 150,000 in central Uttar Pradesh, Singh, 40, typically spends most of his time cracking down on street and festival vendors, like the biryani rice peddler who was spiking his product with an illegal yellow coloring.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But on this day he was following orders from the top: The food-safety commissioner of Uttar Pradesh had called on officers to spend the week raiding supermarkets. The exercise was in preparation for Holi, a spring celebration in which revelers throw colored powders and gorge on snacks. The Easyday, just across the road from Singh\u2019s office and one outlet in a chain that had originally been co-owned by Walmart, was the inspector\u2019s first stop that morning. Singh was intrigued by the no added msg label on the bright-yellow package of noodles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_g.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634614\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_g.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=681\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Food-safety officer Sanjay Singh in the Easyday store in Barabanki, where he first collected a Maggi package for testing in March 2014, kicking off a national scandal.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Like most Indians, Singh was familiar with Maggi. His daughter liked to eat the instant noodles, which are sold in a plastic bag containing two components: a patty of deep-fried noodles, plus the \u201ctastemaker\u201d packet of spices (the same basic components as the ramen noodle packs that are a staple of the diet of college kids in the U.S.). Per standard procedure, Singh sent off one of the four Maggi packages to a laboratory across the state in Gorakhpur for testing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The results, which arrived a few weeks later, surprised the inspector. The Maggi sample had tested positive for MSG, or monosodium glutamate, a controversial ingredient that\u2019s legal in India but requires disclosure and a warning that the product is not recommended for children under 12 months old. A flavor enhancer often associated with Chinese food, MSG has for decades been blamed for everything from bad dreams to cancer\u2014all claims that research has failed to substantiate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-18\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"18\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The fact that the Maggi sample contained MSG when its packaging said it didn\u2019t was a violation punishable with a fine of up to 300,000 rupees\u2014or about $4,500. Had Nestl\u00e9 paid the penalty, this story might have ended there.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But when Nestl\u00e9 India was notified, the company denied adding MSG and appealed the finding. As a result, in June 2014, a second Maggi sample was sent to a different government laboratory more than 600 miles away in Kolkata. After a bizarrely long delay\u2014one that has helped fuel conspiracy theories\u2014the narrative would take a more serious turn.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">An Earthshaking Development<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Nearly a year later, in April 2015, Singh was at the office when the lab report on the second sample finally came back from Kolkata. In a very Indian twist, it had somehow gotten lost in the mail on its way to Kolkata for a period of months\u2014in the process taking a 1,200-mile detour through the Himalayas\u2014and once at the lab, it had apparently ended up at the bottom of a pile.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Singh skimmed the first page of the report and noted that despite the long time gap, everything appeared to be in order. The sample had arrived with the packet seals intact, and the test results were signed and stamped by the director of the lab. He flipped ahead to see whether MSG had shown up again. And, yes, there it was. \u201cMSG: Present.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This report was far more comprehensive than the first one. Singh, an organic chemistry Ph.D., continued methodically down the page until his eye landed on \u201cLead: 17.2 ppm.\u201d Could it really be 17.2 parts per million?<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-0a87f30ac55300593d1a22e3ac27ca89eac4d932\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.knightlab.com\/libs\/timeline3\/latest\/embed\/index.html?source=1NfIbqjF9sM_L0nni5osxypkRaben8Mz_rRSAdqXAMoE&#038;font=Default&#038;lang=en&#038;initial_zoom=2&#038;height=900&#038;iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-0a87f30ac55300593d1a22e3ac27ca89eac4d932\" width=\"100%\" height=\"650\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">He read it again, stunned. According to the report, the Maggi sample contained more than seven times the permissible level of lead\u2014over 1,000 times more than the company claimed was in the product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Lead is naturally present in small concentrations in air, water, and soil, and so it\u2019s expected that trace amounts show up in the food supply. But this was not a trace amount. And significant exposure to lead causes wide-ranging and serious health effects, particularly in children.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Two days later Singh and his colleagues made another morning raid at the Easyday. This time the purpose was to suspend the store\u2019s license for selling substandard food and to collect any tainted noodles. But there was no stock to seize. The Maggi sample that tested positive for lead was from a batch that was long gone from shelves.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As the food officers spoke with the store manager, the earth started to shake violently. They all scrambled for cover as packages tumbled from the shelves. When the shaking stopped, they joked that the earthquake\u2014which they would later discover had killed thousands of people in neighboring Nepal\u2014was the \u201cBoom!\u201d of giant Nestl\u00e9 falling to the ground.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636183\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/noodle-break-c.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=255\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.Maggi.Noodle.02\" width=\"1024\" height=\"255\" \/> <span class=\"credit\">Photograph by The Voorhes for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Polite Superiority<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The headquarters of Nestl\u00e9 India is a five-story, glass-walled building that sits along an eight-lane expressway in Gurgaon, a commercial district about 30 minutes outside central Delhi. Though it\u2019s situated in the middle of a sleek, urban area, cows still occasionally meander across Nestl\u00e9 House\u2019s front lawn.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 began doing business in India in 1912. Today the Swiss parent company owns 63% of Nestl\u00e9 India, which trades separately on the Indian stock exchange. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s operations in India encompass eight factories, an R&amp;D facility focused on developing products for the Indian palate, and more than 7,000 employees.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-maggi-stock.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636666\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-maggi-stock.png?w=1000&#038;h=625\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Click to enlarge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Kolkata lab report arrived in the mail at Nestl\u00e9 House on May 1, 2015, along with a notice from the food-safety commissioner of Uttar Pradesh, and landed on the desk of technical director Aris Protonotarios, the man in charge of quality and safety at Nestl\u00e9 India. A soft-spoken Greek, Protonotarios has spent more than a quarter of a century with Nestl\u00e9. His confidence in his company\u2019s quality assurance systems is such that, he says, he didn\u2019t consider for a minute that any packages of Maggi could have left a factory with lead in them. \u201cTo anyone at Nestl\u00e9, being told your product is unsafe and hazardous is an insult,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me it felt personal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 can trace that attitude all the way back to founder Henri Nestl\u00e9, a self-described \u201cmerchant chemist\u201d who started a company bearing his name in 1866 and was said to obsess over quality. Today Nestl\u00e9 is one of the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable corporations, with some 335,000 employees, and products sold in every country around the world. Last year <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/global500\/nestle-70\/\" target=\"_blank\">it ranked No. 70<\/a> on <i>Fortune\u2019<\/i>s Global 500 list. The multinational has a deep roster of potent brands\u2014including Kit Kat, Nescaf\u00e9, Stouffer\u2019s, and, of course, Maggi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-inida-lab.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636107\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-inida-lab.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Nestle chemists analyze Maggi samples at their Quality Assurance Center in Moga, India.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Nestle India<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Maggi is actually one of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s oldest and largest global brands. It originated in 1863 when Julius Maggi, a Swiss industrialist looking to improve the nutrition of the nation\u2019s workforce, developed condensed pea and bean soups. Maggi\u2019s seasonings, soups, and noodles are now sold in 101 countries.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">People hardly even ate noodles in India when Nestl\u00e9 introduced Maggi in 1983. But the masala spice mix made the taste familiar, and the two-rupee price point made it widely affordable. Marketed to time-pressed mothers\u2014\u201cMummy, I\u2019m hungry\u201d went the product\u2019s popular jingle\u2014Maggi soared to popularity as a children\u2019s snack. Soon it was mainstream comfort food and \u201cMaggi points\u201d\u2014stands at which vendors cook up noodles to order\u2014proliferated.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By 2015, Nestl\u00e9 was manufacturing Maggi at five of its eight Indian factories. Protonotarios says that lead is among the many safety hazards around which Nestl\u00e9 designs its quality assurance system: Each factory regularly checks raw materials, its water supply, and packaging for lead. Nestl\u00e9 India also tests its finished product at each factory every six months, as required by India\u2019s regulations. \u201cThe monitoring process would have picked up something if it wasn\u2019t okay,\u201d says Protonotarios matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd if it had, we would have done something about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-19\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"19\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A check of its records showed no irregularities. So Nestl\u00e9 India prepared a stack of its internal monitoring documents and mailed a response to the Uttar Pradesh food-safety officials on May 5. The company advised the state regulator that, based on its review, no further action should be taken in the case.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In retrospect, it was a stunningly dismissive reaction\u2014and one that would provide a blueprint for more drama to come. Because of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s inherent confidence in its own processes and data, it couldn\u2019t imagine that it might have a problem on its hands. That attitude of detached if polite superiority would irritate officials and exacerbate Nestl\u00e9\u2019s problems, especially when the Indian press got wind of the story.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">\u201cWe Just Had No Control\u201d<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">If the media environment in the U.S. seems overhyped at times, it is downright somnambulant compared with the round-the-clock free-for-all on the subcontinent. India has nearly 400 news networks, and the country\u2019s news debate programs often feature up to eight talking heads on a screen at once. The Maggi controversy would soon became fodder for hours of lively, breathless punditry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The evolution from local issue to national debate was blindingly fast. On May 7, two days after Nestl\u00e9 India sent its response to the health officials, the first stories about problems with Maggi noodles began to appear in Hindi language news coverage in Uttar Pradesh. Shortly after that, employees in Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s social media command center began to notice comments about tainted noodles on Twitter and Maggi\u2019s Facebook page. Khajuria received his late-night phone call in New York on May 11. Within a week speculation about a Maggi ban was everywhere. Yet Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t issue a statement on the matter until May 21, when it asserted that there was \u201cno order to recall Maggi Noodles being sold\u201d and that the product was \u201csafe to eat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_h.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634617\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_h.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=681\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Employees in Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s \u201cdigital acceleration\u201d room monitor social media.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Why wasn\u2019t Nestl\u00e9 more proactive? Partly because, as a general rule, the Nestl\u00e9 way is to deal with authorities directly rather than through the press. Nestl\u00e9 India execs also say they were still gathering facts and doing as much testing of their own as possible. But what\u2019s the use of data if you don\u2019t explain yourself?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">While Nestl\u00e9 stayed mostly quiet, the story metastasized. One of the first days Maggi made news, Maarten Geraets, Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s head of foods, sat down in front of a TV in the company\u2019s boardroom to see what was being said. It was nonstop and not kind; as he flipped channels, he was seized with horror and utter frustration. The Maggi news was on every channel. \u201cWe just had no control.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To outsiders, too, Nestl\u00e9 appeared paralyzed\u2014or worse, guilty. Many Indians took the company\u2019s silence as a sign of wrongdoing. The bigger the story got, the more scattered the coverage became. Some reports focused on \u201cdangerous\u201d MSG, while others focused on lead. Rumors spread in the hinterlands that Maggi contained glass particles\u2014a mix-up due to the linguistic similarity of the words \u201clead\u201d and \u201cglass\u201d in Hindi.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The escalating media attention also put pressure on another entity: the FSSAI, India\u2019s national food regulator. That put a spotlight on Yudhvir Singh Malik, a career civil servant and the FSSAI\u2019s CEO for just half a year when the Maggi scandal broke. In his short tenure he had already tangled with multinationals over labeling and quality issues. However, Nestl\u00e9 was a reputable global company, and the evidence against it was limited to two samples, one of which had taken an unusually long journey to the lab. He decided that more investigation was needed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_k.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634624\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_k.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Yudhveer Singh Malik, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">\u009a Yudhvir Singh Malik, then CEO of India\u2019s central food regulator, the day before he temporarily banned Maggi from shelves in June 2015.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jyoti Kapoor\u2014Solaris Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On May 25, Malik wrote to the state food-safety commissioners\u2014each of India\u2019s 29 states and seven union territories has its own fully empowered food and drug regulator\u2014asking that they test Maggi and submit findings to the FSSAI by June 1. Officials across the nation dispatched inspectors to grab Maggi packets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By this time Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership team in Switzerland was beginning to grasp that something in India was not unfolding as the team\u2019s data said it should.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">From \u201cTechnical Matter\u201d to Crisis<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">For one of the world\u2019s largest consumer-facing companies, Nestl\u00e9 operates at a surprising remove, beginning with its geography. \u201cThe Centre\u201d\u2014as its global headquarters is known\u2014is not near a major hub but in Vevey, a sleepy town of 18,000 on the northern shore of Lake Geneva.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Other than through its marketing, Nestl\u00e9 hasn\u2019t traditionally engaged much with the wider world. It doesn\u2019t generally seek media attention, and its communications department is tiny relative to its size. Until three years ago, Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t have a centralized PR team in the U.S., its largest market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Chalk it up partly to a natural Swiss reserve, but Nestl\u00e9\u2019s aloofness also has to do with the long shadow cast by the company\u2019s notorious baby formula scandal. In 1974 a non-profit called War on Want published a 12-page pamphlet called <i>The Baby Killer<\/i> that excoriated the formula industry for its marketing tactics. In pushing their products over breast-feeding, the document alleged, companies like Nestl\u00e9 had led to the malnourishment and deaths of countless \u201cthird world babies.\u201d The entire industry was targeted, but Nestl\u00e9, as the largest formula company, took the biggest hit. A high-profile boycott of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s products ensued. The company tried many things to stem the criticism, to little avail.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s executives lost their appetite for broad public engagement. \u201cThey felt very quickly attacked,\u201d says Albert Pfiffner, the company\u2019s historian. \u201cIt has taken a generation to overcome this feeling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">During the past decade Nestl\u00e9 has embraced a version of corporate civic duty that is in keeping with its reserved culture: creating shared value, or CSV. The philosophy is that building a sustainable business naturally generates positive social by-products. Why bother with one-off charitable initiatives when you can simply invest for the long term? Today Nestl\u00e9 execs talk about their business almost exclusively through the prism of CSV. The company\u2019s 2015 CSV report, which tracks the company\u2019s 39 societal commitments, from \u201cdelivering nutrition information and advice on all our labels\u201d to \u201cworking against corruption and bribery,\u201d was 351 pages; its annual financial report was 176.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636186\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/noodle-break-3.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=255\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.Maggi.Noodle.05\" width=\"1024\" height=\"255\" \/><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by The Voorhes for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">From his spare, elegant office in the Centre, Bulcke presides over his global business empire with a sort of mathematical laissez-faire, trusting his company\u2019s chain of command. A lanky, blue-eyed Belgian fluent in six languages, the 61-year-old joined Nestl\u00e9 in 1979 and became CEO in 2008. (He was a surprise pick over Paul Polman, who is now Unilever\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ul\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ul\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ul<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> CEO.) Bulcke knows that a company the size of Nestl\u00e9 is bound to run into controversy now and again. That explains his favorite aphorism: Tall trees catch more wind.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When he first heard about the Maggi case, says Bulcke, it struck him as a straightforward technical matter involving testing methods that could be judged and handled by his capable people in the field. \u201cIt was a \u2018What is your spectrometer setting?\u2019 sort of thing,\u201d Bulcke tells me. He says now he was \u201ctoo Cartesian\u201d in his thinking.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By the end of May, his communications team was sounding the alarm that the story was exploding. As he listened to a Maggi crisis conference call on June 2, a couple of things became clear to Bulcke: He had badly miscalculated, and it was time for him to jump in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou feel it,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the morale of the troops, you\u2019ve got to show your nose.\u201d He left for India the next day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">The CEO\u2019s Terrible 24 Hours<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">When Bulcke arrived in India on June 4, he found his top managers preparing to visit the FSSAI. The regulator had called at 10:30 that morning and asked them to come to a meeting at 1 p.m. \u2009The executives were unclear on the agenda, but they didn\u2019t think that Bulcke should go. They feared he was \u201ctoo senior.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke has a breezy, authoritative demeanor, and he dismissed any such notion. \u201cCome on, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px solid #ed1b2e;margin:0 35px 35px;line-height:1.125em;padding:1em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.125em;\">\u201cThis is a case where you can be so right and yet so wrong.

The mood was tense. Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s team complained it had not received test reports from the states and argued that tests were being done improperly. Malik fired back that Nestl\u00e9 would have to ask the states for their test results and that their procedures were proper.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As he listened, Bulcke realized how far apart the two sides were. Looking back, he compares the meeting to watching a house burn down while two firefighters argue over the fire\u2019s cause.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sensing the regulator might do something drastic, Bulcke says he decided what to do almost on the spot: Nestl\u00e9 needed to launch a voluntary recall and pull every variety of Maggi off the shelves.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;float:right;width:40%;margin-left:25px;margin-right:10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_i.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1634619\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_i.jpg?w=367&#038;h=464\" alt=\"Paul Bulcke, Nestle, Maggie Noodles\" width=\"367\" height=\"464\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Nestl\u00e9 CEO Paul Bulcke<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jyoti Kapoor\u2014Solaris Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">His resolve was bolstered that afternoon when states began to ban the noodles. The first ban came from Uttarakhand, a state in northern India, where Nestl\u00e9 had one of its five Maggi factories. Bans in five other states and territories quickly followed\u2014including Delhi, the one that contains the national capital.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke gathered his management team in Nestl\u00e9 House\u2019s fifth-floor boardroom and explained his thinking. Nestl\u00e9 had lost the regulators and had lost the media. The only way to regain control of the narrative\u2014and win back consumers\u2019 trust\u2014would be to pull Maggi and relaunch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Executing the recall would be a gargantuan task. The product they were recalling was in 3.5 million outlets. Plus, it was India, with all its red tape. Each of the 29 states is like its own country, meaning that trucks have to stop at each border for inspection. Vehicles can enter cities only during certain hours, and to do so they must be a certain size. Even with 38 distribution centers across the country, some of Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s products take 13 days to get to market. The company would need to reverse-engineer this process. And it would have to do something with all those noodles. Nevertheless, Bulcke was determined about the course of action.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 set a press conference for noon the next day to announce the news, and at 12:30 a.m. the company sent a short statement to the Indian stock exchange: \u201cIn spite of Maggi noodles being safe, Nestl\u00e9 India decides to take the product off shelves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria notified Malik a short while later by text: \u201cWe have decided to take Maggi noodles off shelves.\u201d Bulcke went to his hotel and, he says, \u201cgot a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">An Uphill Journey Begins<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The head of the FSSAI was not satisfied with the developments. Though Maggi would be pulled from the market, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s press statement insisted on the product\u2019s safety. Meanwhile, he had mounting evidence from labs around the country indicating otherwise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So the regulator countered Nestl\u00e9\u2019s move by implementing a temporary national ban of Maggi.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Aware of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s 12 p.m. press event, Malik punched out an eight-page order calling on Nestl\u00e9 to respond within 15 days with a reason that product approval for all varieties of Maggi noodles should not be revoked. He fired it off to Nestl\u00e9 India by email at 11:15 a.m., and the news broke while Bulcke was meeting the media.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The press conference took place in a high-ceilinged hall in Delhi\u2019s Oberoi Hotel. Despite the short notice, journalists packed the room, and Indian news channels broke into their programming to air the CEO\u2019s remarks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_j.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634622\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_j.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=482\" alt=\"Paul Bulcke, Nestle, Maggi Noodles\" width=\"1024\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">At a tense press conference in Delhi on June 5, 2015, Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke explained the decision to recall Maggi.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Ajay Agarwal\u2014Hindustan Times via Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke kept his opening comments to five minutes and a few key points: Maggi is safe; consumer trust has been shaken by unfounded concerns; we\u2019re working with authorities; we are committed to India.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then the floor was opened up to questions, and the room erupted as the 200 journalists demanded answers from Bulcke: Why had it taken Nestl\u00e9 two weeks to make a statement? If Maggi was safe, was he saying the government labs were wrong? No, he replied, he wasn\u2019t criticizing the government\u2019s science. For 45 minutes he gulped Perrier from a goblet and managed to keep his cool.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke flew out later that evening. He had been in India for roughly 24 hours, and things had seemingly gone from bad to worse. But the CEO left the country feeling happy and confident that things were about to turn around: \u201cIt was the first step of an uphill journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">We\u2019ll Settle This in Court<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The next step would be played out in the courts. The FSSAI had given Nestl\u00e9 India 15 days to respond to its order, which threatened the company with permanent loss of Maggi\u2019s product approvals. Responding with an explanation was one option; suing was another.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Filing suit against the FSSAI, the agency that regulated not just Maggi but also Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s many other products, was risky. But six words in the FSSAI order were especially troubling to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s executives: \u201cunsafe and hazardous for human consumption.\u201d They felt the phrase exposed them to legal action. Millions of people in India ate Maggi. What was to stop anyone who had health problems from blaming Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On June 11, six days after the government issued its temporary ban, Nestl\u00e9 India filed suit against the FSSAI in Bombay High Court.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Maggi proceedings spanned the summer months and became a media spectacle of their own. At the heart of the case was whether the government order to ban the sale of Maggi was legal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-mistakes-maggi-crisis-sidebar.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1634739\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-mistakes-maggi-crisis-sidebar.png?w=780&#038;h=901\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 mistakes maggi crisis sidebar\" width=\"780\" height=\"901\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s case was this: The FSSAI hadn\u2019t given the company a proper hearing and had failed to follow \u201cprinciples of natural justice\u201d by issuing its order. The order, Nestl\u00e9 argued, caused the company heavy financial losses and did irreparable damage to its reputation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Further, Nestl\u00e9 said, the rationale for the order was bogus, having been based on select findings of unaccredited laboratories that used improper testing methods. The FSSAI based its ban on test results for 72 samples of Maggi done by various state labs, 30 of which were found to have elevated levels of lead, though none nearly as high as the report that kicked off the crisis. But Nestl\u00e9 argued that the government had ignored overwhelming evidence\u2014the roughly 2,700 lab reports Nestl\u00e9 had submitted from internal and external labs at that point\u2014that indicated lead levels were under the permissible limit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The government case asserted that the order for the temporary ban was an urgent matter of public safety and that the regulator did give Nestl\u00e9 a hearing when Malik met with the company\u2019s officials on June 4.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Moreover, the government argued, the order caused Nestl\u00e9 no undue harm: The company had already recalled Maggi. The government\u2019s ban was temporary, covering just a 15-day period. All Nestl\u00e9 had to do was respond satisfactorily\u2014which it couldn\u2019t do because the product wasn\u2019t safe. Nestl\u00e9 had decided to incinerate the 37,000 tons of Maggi it had collected. Why would a company recall a perfectly safe product and burn it? The government order hadn\u2019t mandated that Nestl\u00e9 get rid of the noodles. (Though regulators had okayed it.) That act was tantamount to a cover-up. Likewise, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s many thousands of test results could have been easily fabricated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">The Big Question<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Was there lead in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The widest, most puzzling, and most important divide in the Maggi affair is over that seemingly simple question. Several state governments in India tested Maggi samples and reported elevated levels of lead. Nestl\u00e9 ran its thousands of tests and declared that no problem existed. Who was right?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Testing for lead is straightforward with sophisticated lab equipment, the findings unequivocal and reliable. Government lab analysts, though paid less than corporate colleagues, are a trained and educated group, says Ashwin Bhadri, CEO of Equinox Labs, one of India\u2019s leading private lab companies. That said, he acknowledges the labs are dreadfully underresourced and stuck with antiquated instruments. \u201cSome are 20 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the manpower or the chemicals to run the equipment. It\u2019s really sad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A week after the Maggi ban, a former director of Kolkata\u2019s Central Food Laboratory, Satya Prakash, reportedly sent a letter to the Prime Minister\u2019s office and the nation\u2019s health minister expressing concern over the nation\u2019s lack of noodle-testing standards. In 2013, Prakash, who retired in 2009, published a scathing article in which he declared \u201cthe working conditions of labs are anything but functional.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-20\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"20\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In stark contrast, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Quality Assurance Center in India sits, like a glass jewel, at the center of the company\u2019s well-manicured campus in Moga. The day I visited, a scientist in a crisp white lab coat met me in the building\u2019s foyer. He greeted me warmly before turning quickly, and with discernible bitterness, to the differences between a government lab and the pristine, state-of-the-art space he was about to show me. Government labs are likely to use cheap household blenders to mix food samples, he said; Nestl\u00e9 has a $5,000 contamination-proof titanium blade. Nestl\u00e9 uses pricey porcelain bowls to hold substances, whereas the government labs probably use inexpensive ceramic ones that leach, and so on. Standing there, it was hard to imagine contamination happening in such an environment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yet Nestl\u00e9\u2019s money and its vaunted commitment to quality haven\u2019t prevented other safety-related recalls. In March the company voluntarily recalled 3 million DiGiorno, Stouffer\u2019s, and Lean Cuisine products in the U.S. \u201cbecause of the potential presence of glass pieces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Many Indians, including professionals with knowledge of the food industry, continue to suspect that there was something wrong with Maggi. They find it hard to fathom that so many government tests could be wrong, and they suggest the food giant got a little sloppy in one of its factories, where lead-contaminated water or raw material or old equipment\u2014possibly combined with the lax oversight of contract workers\u2014caused the problem.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the absence of a definitive answer, the next best thing would be a legal ruling.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Conspiracy Theories Abound<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">While the High Court of Bombay weighed the facts of the Maggi case, the affair stirred up debate around what was already a hot-button question in India: Is the presence of big foreign companies good or bad for the country?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Enter the yogi.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Suspicion of multinational companies in India is deeply rooted and very much alive\u2014perhaps most prominently in the hulking yet limber form of Baba Ramdev, a colorful yoga guru and the face of India\u2019s fastest-growing consumer goods company. Ramdev, 50, has long hair and a dark, bushy beard; he became famous in the early 2000s by leading TV yoga workouts in a saffron-colored loincloth. He parlayed his celebrity into the launch of Patanjali Ayurved, an ayurvedic medicine company, in 2006. Before long his followers were flocking to his ever-expanding line of all-natural products. (Toothpaste and ghee are his top sellers.) The goods are dirt cheap and marketed as <i>swadeshi<\/i>, or Indian. Increasingly he is taking market share from global giants like Colgate and Unilever.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ramdev is vociferously anti\u2013multinational corporations. He rails against the money they drain from the country and the ills they\u2019ve introduced to India, calling Coca-Cola and Western-style processed foods \u201cslow poison.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As Nestl\u00e9\u2019s troubles escalated, the coincidences were too good for many on social media to resist. Twitter and WhatsApp buzzed with giddy speculation that Baba Ramdev himself was behind the scandal or that he would swoop in to the rescue by launching his own Patanjali instant noodles. Finally, in mid-June, Ramdev said that after months of research\u2014wholly unrelated to Maggi\u2014Patanjali planned to launch a line of locally sourced whole-wheat noodles in late 2015.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:80%;margin-left:10%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634633\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_n.jpg?w=1003&#038;h=1455\" alt=\"Baba Ramdev, Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1003\" height=\"1455\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Yoga guru and entrepreneur Baba Ramdev capitalized on the Maggi crisis to launch his own line of \u201clead and MSG-free\u201d instant noodles last November.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jyoti Kapoor\u2014Solaris Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">The guru didn\u2019t miss a chance to get in a shot at Nestl\u00e9. \u201cMaggi should apologize,\u201d said Ramdev in early June. \u201cAnd if the government takes strong measures, the company should be asked to pack up and leave the country. We don\u2019t need a company that serves poison.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On June 30 the High Court of Bombay offered Nestl\u00e9 some relief: It allowed the company to resume manufacturing Maggi for export. Singapore and Australia had already pronounced the noodles safe for sale and consumption; Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. would do so as well in the following weeks. For many it raised the question: If Maggi was fine for consumers in those developed nations, why not for the people of India?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Others reached a different conclusion. Of course the <i>exported<\/i> product was safe, I was told by some people\u2014a few of them Indian officials. Nestl\u00e9 sells a higher-quality product in other countries, these people claimed; in India, where the population and authorities have traditionally been less discerning, it pushes substandard goods. Not only was Nestl\u00e9 guilty of selling tainted noodles, these folks asserted, but it did so willfully and then engaged in a cover-up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px solid #ed1b2e;margin:0 35px 35px;line-height:1.125em;padding:1em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.125em;\">\u201cMaggi should apologize, and if the government takes strong measures, the company should be asked to pack up and leave the country.

One of the most common things I was told while in India was some form of this: \u201cThere are some politics behind this case.\u201d When I\u2019d push people further on this point, accounts diverged wildly. One person might point to strained diplomatic relations between India and Switzerland over banking secrecy. Another might suggest that Nestl\u00e9 had been set up after refusing to make \u201cpolitical contributions\u201d to corrupt officials.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The possibilities are endless, and most of them have been debated in some corner of India. But Kilbinder Dosanjh, a director at risk-consulting firm Eurasia Group, says the Maggi case is less a story of unique political dynamics than a classic tale of institutional weakness in India. In that way it is the opposite of conspiracy. It\u2019s about regulatory incoherence. \u201cWhen it came to tests of these noodles, there were multiple levels of institutions dealing with this,\u201d he says. \u201cYou had state and central bodies that complicated who was responsible and what standards they were using.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Good News at Last<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">While Nestl\u00e9 waited for the high court to render its verdict, the company took steps to up its communications game. Though it stayed silent on matters before the court, the company created a Maggi information hub on its website, where visitors could view its lab reports and read up on MSG. It publicized its recall efforts. And it invited journalists to tour its Quality Assurance Center in Moga.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 India also got a boost in late July from the arrival of Suresh Narayanan as its new top executive. Narayanan, 56, had spent the previous decade covering the globe for Nestl\u00e9. In April 2015 he\u2019d been transferred to the Philippines after a lively four-year stint running Nestl\u00e9\u2019s businesses in Egypt, Libya, and Sudan. But after the Maggi situation blew up, Narayanan got a call from his boss, Wan Ling Martello, the head of Nestl\u00e9 Asia, Oceana, and Africa, asking him to move again. \u201cI need you in India,\u201d she told him.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/suresh-narayanan.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636110\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/suresh-narayanan.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Suresh Narayanan in his office at Nestle' House in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi, India. \" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Suresh Narayanan in his office at Nestle&#8217; House in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi, India.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The ebullient Narayanan, an Indian himself, had begun his career with Nestl\u00e9 in the sales department in Gurgaon, and he still knew many of Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s employees and the market. He had also proved to be an expert and versatile crisis manager. In Singapore, for example, he took over just as the financial crisis hit and still managed to grow sales in a mature market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Narayanan wasted no time signaling that he would be leading Nestl\u00e9 India in a very different way. He gave an interview to the Indian press the same day he arrived. A week later he spoke for 45 minutes live on CNBC, declaring his first mission was \u201cto bring Maggi back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px solid #ed1b2e;margin:0 35px 35px;line-height:1.125em;padding:1em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.125em;\">\u201cWhen you manage an issue in India, you\u2019re dealing with a certain set of known entities but also a much larger set of unknown entities. It\u2019s like being shot at in the dark.\u201d <span style=\"font-size:.875em;color:#ed1b2e;\">\u2014<em>Suresh Narayanan<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">His words proved prophetic.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On Aug. 13, a couple of weeks after Narayanan\u2019s arrival, the High Court of Bombay delivered its judgment in the case. In a ruling that was unusually long\u2014145 pages\u2014the court sided with Nestl\u00e9. It overturned the ban, declaring that the FSSAI had acted arbitrarily. The judgment allowed Nestl\u00e9 India to resume sales of Maggi, on the condition that another round of samples\u201490 in all\u2014be tested for lead and cleared in the following six weeks by three labs accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s executives had crowded into the boardroom to watch TV coverage of the decision. Narayanan was texting updates to Martello back in Vevey until it became clear to him that it was good news. Then he sent her one more message: \u201c<small>WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON,<\/small>\u201d and added smiley emoticons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">A Nation Gets Its Noodles Back<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The relaunch of Maggi was scheduled for Monday, Nov. 9\u2014five months and four days after the government ban, and an auspicious day in India known as Dhanteras. The first day of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, it carries associations of well-being and prosperity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 had gotten official clearance from the Bombay High Court in October and spent weeks preparing. Nestl\u00e9 India was eager to build demand after the product\u2019s months-long absence from shelves. The company\u2019s marketers began with young people, who had proved a forgiving and fiercely loyal fan base; they had been clamoring for Maggi\u2019s return practically since the trouble began, and for them Nestl\u00e9 launched a #WeMissYouToo campaign on YouTube\u2014a series of minute-long spots starring handsome bachelors who are forlorn without their instant noodles. To court mothers, it got real moms to give video testimonials about why they still trusted Maggi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-assembly-line.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636112\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-assembly-line.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles come off the manufacturing line after the ban lifted in one of Nestle's 5 Indian factories. \" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Maggi Noodles come off the manufacturing line after the ban lifted in one of Nestle&#8217;s 5 Indian factories.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Nestle India<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For symbolic reasons Nestl\u00e9 delivered the product as widely as possible on day one. Trucks loaded with instant noodles and festooned Indian-style with colorful tassels and decals rolled out just after midnight. The no added msg label on the packages had been replaced by a new logo reading &#8220;Our commitment to goodness you can always trust.&#8221; Narayanan gave dozens of interviews repeating some version of a simple message: \u201cMaggi is safe, was safe, and always will be safe.\u201d There were Maggi-eating celebrations at Nestl\u00e9 sites across the country.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They celebrated in Vevey too. Maggi was served at an executive board meeting. The instant-noodle dish was the second of four courses, between Terrine Saint-Hubert and fried sturgeon served with cr\u00e8me de caviar d\u2019Aquitaine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Taking the Long View<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Maggi noodles may be back on shelves, but the Maggi saga is far from over. The Monday after the big relaunch, the FSSAI filed an appeal of the Bombay court decision in India\u2019s Supreme Court. There is another legal case pending. On Aug. 12, 2015, the day before the ban was lifted, the government had sued Nestl\u00e9 India for $99 million. The complaint, lodged on behalf of consumers by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, alleged the same basic things the FSSAI\u2019s order had: that the company had sold unsafe products and misled consumers through its advertising practices. Both cases continue to work their way through the Indian courts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, Nestl\u00e9 has a wily new competitor in the noodle market. A week after the Maggi relaunch, Baba Ramdev introduced his new Patanjali noodles. They\u2019re made from atta, a \u201chealthier\u201d whole-wheat flour, and cost 10 rupees less than Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Maggi equivalent. As the robed guru whipped up a batch for media onlookers in a Delhi mall, he noted that Patanjali\u2019s product was lead- and MSG-free. Then, for the cameras, he enthusiastically slurped some down, noodles tangling in his beard.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-relaunch.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636109\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-relaunch.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Maggie noodles return to Bhopal, India in November 2015.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Sanjeev Gupta\u2014EPA\/Corbis<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The fates of the other characters in the Maggi drama have diverged. Sanjay Singh, the inspector whose curiosity about MSG kicked off the whole crisis, received a public service award in Barabanki in January for his good work. Malik, the CEO of the FSSAI, was shifted out of his position a month after the Bombay High Court decision and transferred to India\u2019s central planning commission, where he was given a job as an \u201cadditional secretary.\u201d Meanwhile, some government officials remain incensed with Nestl\u00e9, particularly over the arrogance of its recent marketing efforts\u2014the \u201cMaggi is safe, was safe, and always will be safe\u201d language irks them. For those burnishing Brand India, the episode can\u2019t go away fast enough.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As for Nestl\u00e9, Bulcke and his team acknowledge that they didn\u2019t play the Maggi crisis perfectly. But they defend their decision-making generally\u2014particularly the choice to privilege communication with regulators over reaction to the media. They talk about how they managed the crisis with long-term rather than short-term outcomes in mind. Nestl\u00e9 has been in India for 100 years, Bulcke stresses, and it wants to be there 100 more. You can\u2019t achieve that in a country if you blow up your relationship with the regulators.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In any case, the global giant was given an important lesson in the unpredictability of one its most promising growth markets. \u201cWhen you manage an issue in India, you\u2019re dealing with a certain set of known entities but also a much larger set of unknown entities,\u201d says Narayanan, the Nestl\u00e9 India managing director. \u201cWho is going to set off what bullet at you is what you have to keep anticipating. Where the hell is this next bullet going to come from? It\u2019s like being shot at in the dark.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The next time Nestl\u00e9 hears gunfire, maybe it will be ready to duck.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Nestl\u00e9&#8217;s Hot Mess.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"April 26, 2016","published":"2016-04-26 06:30:36","updated":"2016-04-26 06:30:36","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Half-Billion-Dollar Noodle Debacle in India","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-maggi-noodles-with-headline.png?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Photograph by The Voorhes  for Fortune Magazine; Type by Sinelab  ","caption":"","attach_id":1634144},"excerpt":"A cautionary tale of mangled crisis management.","authors":[{"id":"462357","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/erika-fry\/","name":"Erika Fry","twitter":"ErikaFry","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/ericafry.jpg?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"WRITER HEADSHOTS \u2014 Erica Fry headshot\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/ericafry.jpg?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Erika Fry is a reporter at Fortune","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"A cautionary tale of mangled crisis management.","seo":{"seo_title":"Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Half-Billion-Dollar Noodle Debacle in India","seo_description":"Nestl\u00e9 spent three decades building a beloved noodle brand in India.

If that sounds like a <i>Nova<\/i> special, it was so much more. Doctors, medical students, and the merely curious experienced the operation in real time, with 360-degree control over their vantage points, as though they were actually in the operating room.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By now you\u2019ve probably heard the hype about the coming wave of virtual reality (VR) and the miracles that it can render in videogames, entertainment, and exploration. Interested in flying a Black Hawk helicopter over the Dubai skyline just after dawn? It can put you there. How about walking in Neil Armstrong\u2019s footsteps on the moon, or on the summit of Mount Everest? Done and done. But the live stream was a showcase of the wondrous potential of VR to educate, to train, and, more generally, to transport the masses into situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It was a mere glimpse of what Medical Realities has in mind. Imagine, for example, enabling students to actually feel the resistance when a scalpel cuts muscle. For now, workplace applications for VR tend to be rather prosaic\u2014think virtual conferencing\u2014and much of the effort to create compelling content is focused on games and entertainment. But it provides a striking vision of the potential reach and practicality of VR in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Tech powerhouses\u2014Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"googl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/google-40\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">googl<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Samsung, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"msft\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft-31\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">msft<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Sony <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"sne\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sne\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">sne<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"aapl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple-5\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">aapl<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Intel <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"intc\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/intel-52\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">intc<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and others\u2014are creating VR hardware and software to establish a platform that they all say will rival the appeal and utility of the mobile phone or even the Internet itself. And a second, potentially much broader echelon of companies is trying to get out in front of the trend, dreaming up VR applications to change how we shop, advertise, learn, and communicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By some estimates, the market for VR will be worth $150 billion within four years. A decade from now, who knows? It\u2019s impossible to say because no one\u2019s clear on what the platform is best suited to do. But the race is on to figure it out. Never mind that some of the largest players have tried to put things on your face before: 3-D spectacles, Google Glass, and previous incarnations of VR headsets. Those were inferior technologies, they say. This time is different. Try it for yourself and you\u2019ll understand that those technologies died so this one could live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_a1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1638138\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_a1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=725\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"725\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Programmer Tina Roh works in the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Linda A. Cicero\u2014Stanford News<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite feverish press<\/span> coverage of VR, two-thirds of the U.S. population remains unaware of the technology, according to a survey by research firm Horizon Media. That suggests a definition is in order. There are a few flavors of the technology: virtual reality, augmented reality, and a combination known as mixed reality. They all use a special headset to alter human perception and, in effect, take you somewhere or enable you to see something that would otherwise be invisible. We\u2019re lumping all the technologies under the term VR in this article, both for simplicity\u2019s sake and because all the permutations share the same roots.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Remember View-Master, the toy that debuted 77 years ago and delighted children by transporting them from their bedrooms to the Taj Mahal or the Great Smoky Mountains? Consider it an ancestor. The flight simulators of the 1980s were early incarnations. Then there were the headsets developed and abandoned by Sega and Nintendo in the \u201990s. At that point the Internet captured everybody\u2019s attention, and VR was largely forgotten. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">That all changed when Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"fb\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook-242\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">fb<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> paid $2 billion to buy the current VR poster child, Oculus, in 2014, from a 21-year-old entrepreneur named Palmer Luckey. Oculus didn\u2019t have a commercially available product at the time. But its demo was powerful enough to convince Mark Zuckerberg of VR\u2019s far-reaching utility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1636556-21\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"21\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The wisdom of his bet will be tested in the coming months. The company\u2019s first headset, Oculus Rift, priced at $599, or roughly $1,500 with a PC powerful enough to run it, began shipping in March. The Rift provides an experience unlike anything that has ever been available to consumers, thanks to remarkable advancements in screen resolution, positional tracking and movement sensors, haptic technologies (the processes that make phones and videogame controllers vibrate), computational horsepower, 3-D graphics, and audio. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Oculus executives are careful not to promise immediate mass-market success. For starters, the very mention of VR may cause ennui in some quarters and trigger memories of past promises unfulfilled. And companies will need to overcome people\u2019s aversion to wearing a snorkel-style mask. So executives have talking points to address those issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cVR has come and gone many times,\u201d says Jason Rubin, the head of content at Oculus and a legend in the gaming community. His videogames, including the <i>Crash Bandicoot<\/i> series, have sold more than 40 million copies. He\u2019s been into VR for as long as he can recall, but lately he\u2019s become fanatical. \u201cIf you go back and look at the \u201990s VR, people were basically wearing [cathode ray] TVs on their faces,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were -blurry and loud. Now we have high-resolution, low-cost screens with high refresh rates and low latency.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The constant improvement of technology has enabled the Oculus Rift to cross an indefinable but crucial threshold: It can now create situations that <i>simply feel real<\/i>. Rubin thinks gaming will be the first market, then compelling content will bring wider use. \u201cThe ramp up from launch to widespread adoption might not be as fast as it was with the smartphone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut over the long run it will be the same scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The tech giants are staking their claims. Google moved for the low end with a cardboard-and-plastic device that turns a smartphone into a VR experience. It also recently launched a VR division with far greater aspirations and invested in the startup Magic Leap, which has raised more than $1.3 billion in funding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Meanwhile, Microsoft has the HoloLens. It \u201caugments\u201d reality by layering holographic images on top of what you see of the actual world, with a headset that looks like a combination of sunglasses and a typical VR mask. The company, which is working with Autodesk <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"adsk\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/autodesk-862\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">adsk<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Japan Airlines, NASA, and Volvo, among others, intends it to enable all sorts of training and exploration scenarios. Microsoft began shipping developer kits in March but hasn\u2019t said when a consumer version will appear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Intel is putting its weight behind VR as a way to help boost PC sales. Netflix <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nflx\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix-474\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nflx<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> has a VR app. Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"amzn\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com-29\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">amzn<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> is reportedly working on one as well. And Apple is definitely up to something. The company is mum about its plans (though CEO Tim Cook has declared interest), but officials are happy to forward leaked reports about how they\u2019re hiring hundreds of people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At Nvidia <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nvda\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/nvidia-553\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nvda<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, general manager Jason Paul tells me the graphics-chip company has created a new line of chips for VR and even recently formed a new division devoted to the cause. He identifies VR as one of its three strategic growth areas, and with good reason: VR rendering requires seven times as much graphics horsepower as 1080p HD rendering. \u201cOver the last three years the technology and performance has come down to the point where it\u2019s possible to think about a mass-market audience,\u201d Paul says. \u201cVR is going to touch every industry from gaming to automotive to entertainment, and we\u2019re focused on helping build the ecosystem and deliver performance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-sidebar-vr-getting-real_v21.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637935 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-sidebar-vr-getting-real_v21.png?w=790&#038;h=1293\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.sidebar VR getting real_v2\" width=\"790\" height=\"1293\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"credit\">Illustrations by Nico 189 for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">On my recent visit, he and his team show several demos. One put me in a $180,000 Audi R8. I was able to sit in the sports car\u2019s front seat and even stick my head inside the engine. From this and the work Volvo is doing with Microsoft, it seems clear that the traditional test-drive will soon be augmented by the living room experience. You\u2019ll hear the roar of the engine and feel the vibrations of the steering wheel as you hit autobahn speeds on a twisting alpine road\u2014all from the safety of your sofa. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The arms race has already begun for selling headsets. Samsung has its Gear VR, produced with Oculus, which retails for $99 and uses a Samsung phone as the display. The company won\u2019t disclose the number of units sold since the Gear launched in November, but it\u2019s using TV ads and promotions to seed the marketplace. One recent offer: Anyone who buys a Galaxy S7 gets a free headset and six VR games. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of friction to adopting VR. If we can lower the barriers, that helps us explain why VR is so amazing, innovative, and powerful,\u201d says Nick DiCarlo, Samsung\u2019s GM of immersive products and VR. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a level of simulation quality that might\u2019ve been possible only in a $1 million system just 20 or even 10 years ago.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1636556-22\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"22\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the tech trade show CES early this year, the real excitement surrounded VR gaming. Thousands lined up outside the Oculus, HTC\u2014which launched its $799 Vive system in April\u2014and Sony PlayStation booths for the chance to spend five minutes playing VR games. PlayStation executives hope that excitement reflects how 36 million PS4 owners will react when the $399 PlayStation VR is released in October. Sony will be doing everything it can to turn gamers into proselytizers. Because as executives readily admit, the power of VR can\u2019t be conveyed through TV commercials. In the words of VP of marketing John Koller, \u201cYou just have to try it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-nick-dicarlo_v3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637926 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-nick-dicarlo_v3.png?w=790&#038;h=391\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.pullquote Nick DiCarlo_v3\" width=\"790\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"credit\">Photo: eVRydayVR<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The emergence <\/span><span class=\"s2\">of any new platform inevitably brings questions about its utility\u2014and even the businesses that first roll it out often fail to predict how it will ultimately be used.

Same with the Internet and the mobile phone. Visionaries predicted companies would one day send geotagged coupons to people\u2019s cellphones. No one saw Uber coming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Plenty of people are trying to envision compelling applications of VR. Among the more astute and sober is Jeremy Bailenson, head of Stanford University\u2019s VR lab and co-author of <i>Infinite Reality: The Hidden Blueprint of Our Virtual Lives<\/i>. He\u2019s responsible for exposing VR to captains of industry (including Zuckerberg) and heads of state (President Obama opted not to wear the headset). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Bailenson is delighted by the attention VR has been getting. It has meant large increases in funding and staff. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a real energy in the space, and we can actually produce things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But he\u2019s quick to manage expectations. \u201cMost things don\u2019t work in VR. If you show me 20 ideas, I\u2019ll say 19 of them would be better in another medium,\u201d Bailenson says. \u201cI think VR is best for special, intense experiences\u2009&#8230;\u2009things that are expensive, dangerous, counterproductive, or impossible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-jeremy-bailenson_v3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637923 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-jeremy-bailenson_v3.png?w=790&#038;h=391\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.pullquote Jeremy Bailenson_v3\" width=\"790\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Brad Wenner<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">At his lab, I experience a series of demos that turn me\u2014a forty-something, able-bodied white guy\u2014into various form factors, including a black woman confronting an epithet-spewing racist on a city street and a disabled veteran without full use of his limbs. Clearly, Bailenson feels VR is great at fostering empathy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">He also has a capitalist streak. In January, Bailenson co-founded the VR software firm Striver, which is working with a dozen professional and college athletic teams. \u201cWith football,\u201d he says, \u201cthe teams see a huge win just getting extra repetition. You learn to recognize defenses and how to change the play at the line of scrimmage.\u201d Without, I hasten to add, fear of concussion. \u201cIn baseball, it\u2019s batters realizing what pitch is coming. It\u2019s about making decisions, experiencing something over and over, and driving that experience into your recognition.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The value of such education is hardly limited to sports. NASA uses VR to teach technicians how to repair satellites. Lowe\u2019s recently rolled out its Holoroom, which uses Oculus Rift to help customers make remodeling decisions, in seven test markets. \u201cOur first name for the Holoroom was the Marriage Savior,\u201d says Kyle Nel, executive director of Lowe\u2019s Innovation Labs. \u201cThe intent was to learn what we could do to be successful in a world where virtual and augmented reality aren\u2019t just cool but part of everyday life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_d1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1638137\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_d1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Lockheed Martin often combines virtual reality with real-world equipment when training pilots to fly fighter jets.

Muir is showing off the convoy training experience. He\u2019s perched atop an actual Humvee, ducking behind a shield while gripping an actual modified .50-caliber machine gun and an M4 automatic rifle. The rifle is equipped with infrared lasers and a wireless BlueFire magazine, and it uses 3,000 PSI of compressed nitrogen to simulate the sounds of gunfire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cHold tight here,\u201d he says.

My heart\u2019s pounding, and I\u2019m just a spectator. Eventually the insurgents retreat, and the simulation stops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s not the most realistic demo I\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re not wearing headsets. The characters projected on the screen are cartoony. But people don\u2019t require photo-realism to feel what VR experts call \u201cpresence.\u201d Many factors signal reality to our brains, including motion, peripheral action, and sound. And the sound here is absolutely unnerving. It\u2019s crucial to get used to it, says Lockheed Martin\u2019s director of advanced technology, Atul Patel.\u201cThe worst thing that could happen on the battlefield is that you end up reacting negatively because you\u2019ve never been in that scenario.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Lockheed Martin has been using VR since the late \u201990s. It has trained more than 400,000 soldiers in the convoy training experience alone. On my visit, I \u201cfly\u201d an F-16 and take a tour to see how the company is using VR to train pilots of the world\u2019s most advanced fighter jet, the F-35 Lightning II. Sending a pilot into an actual F-35 for a warlike experience with adversaries, air threats, and partners might cost $1 million per hour or more. Do it virtually and it\u2019s a small fraction of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s not just war games. Halfway across the country, Darin Bolthouse manages one of the world\u2019s largest VR facilities for space systems, Lockheed Martin\u2019s collaborative human immersive lab in Denver. Bolthouse and his team have incorporated VR into some 90 projects over the past year, including the next generation of GPS satellites. It helps engineers discover new approaches and answer vexing questions. \u201cI can set up a VR scenario in a matter of minutes,\u201d says Bolthouse, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re saving in the range of $10 to $15 million a year by using it. That\u2019s a conservative estimate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-kyle-nel_v3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637924 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-kyle-nel_v3.png?w=790&#038;h=391\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.pullquote Kyle Nel_v3\" width=\"790\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"credit\">Photograph Courtesy of Lowe&#8217;s<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">What would you<\/span> <span class=\"s2\">do if you had 300 million fans in China? For the NBA, the question isn\u2019t hypothetical. The basketball league enjoys an enthusiastic Chinese following, not to mention millions of fans in other countries, the vast majority of whom will never attend an NBA game. In the U.S. it has inventory constraints. With some teams, at least, demand for seats far outstrips supply. Which leaves a lot of potential revenue on the table. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Jeff Marsilio thinks VR can help solve these problems. He\u2019s the NBA\u2019s vice president of global media distribution. Marsilio first experienced VR as a teenager in a Connecticut arcade and now declares it the future of live sports. The NBA broadcast its first live VR game last October, and Marsilio invited me to Los Angeles to witness one of its production vendors, NextVR, film a game between the L.A. Clippers and the Denver Nuggets. We join the NextVR crew at the Staples Center. It\u2019s a fairly bare-bones operation: just a few people peering into monitors and a feed from two stationary, unmanned cameras, one behind each basket. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s clear the experience needs refining. The Gear VR uses a mobile phone as its display, the electronic equivalent of watching a game through a screen door. That said, I\u2019m transported to somewhere it would otherwise be impossible to be. It\u2019d be an exaggeration to say it feels like I\u2019m on the court, but it\u2019s far more immersive than regular TV. The camera angles switch with the game flow, so the action is always coming at me, and the NBA\u2019s grueling pace of play becomes especially pronounced.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-15-virtual-reality-nba.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1638107\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-15-virtual-reality-nba.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Testing a virtual reality telecast for the NBA.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein\/NBAE Via Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">As I watch, the NextVR team brainstorms how best to use audio, where to put the score, how to incorporate social sharing, and how to establish the new rules of engagement. \u201cThe technologies are all progressing so fast,\u201d says Brad Allen, NextVR\u2019s executive chairman, holding up a headset. \u201cThink of these as the equivalent of the brick cellphone.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">When I ask Marsilio what kind of revenue opportunity VR represents, he demurs. \u201cWe\u2019re putting monetization on the back burner. Our fundamental strategy is to bring fans closer to the game, and VR does that in a new way. This has the potential to be the most fundamental shift in how we experience content, ever. The money will follow.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The next day, at NextVR\u2019s offices in Laguna Beach, Calif., executives show me a VR demo of sports, from mixed martial arts to baseball, and discuss a deal they signed with FoxSports. They explain that NextVR is using the same video-compression technologies they originally developed for 3-D TV in 2009. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">What makes them so sure VR won\u2019t follow the same trajectory as 3-D TV? \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison. 3-D was a TV that had depth added to it. But VR is a whole new medium,\u201d says DJ Roller, a NextVR co-founder. \u201cWith VR, you\u2019re no longer experiencing something from the outside. You\u2019re in the event. It allows fans to not just be in a front-row seat but to be in a place that you can\u2019t even buy a ticket.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_h.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1637480\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_h.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Elizabeth Baron, a Ford technical specialist uses VR to evaluate a vehicle before it is built.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Ford Motors<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">Ted Leonsis knows<\/span> a thing or two about the emergence of new media.

These days he\u2019s the CEO of Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, which owns the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, among other things. While reporting this story, I hear he\u2019s become a VR fanboy and that the Wizards staff is using it to train players. So I arrange a call. Leonsis gushes over VR\u2019s utility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I ask whether the goggles will impede acceptance. After all, we humans have a thing about our eyes. Some cultures abhor eye contact. In others, looking away is rude. But covering one\u2019s eyes with anything other than sunglasses just seems antisocial. I ask whether he\u2019s ever tried Google Glass.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1636556-23\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"23\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Leonsis laughs. \u201cI have them right here next to me,\u201d he says, launching into a soliloquy. \u201cI haven\u2019t worn them in two years. But that\u2019s first generation. We know optical tools and the Internet of things will become more and more mainstream. They\u2019ll get faster, cheaper, lighter, and smaller, and better apps will be developed. What will drive the social adoption? It\u2019ll be videogames\u2009\u2026\u2009two-screen environments where you\u2019re playing a game, having an experience. Say we want to go see Niagara Falls together. We\u2019re both wearing the headsets, standing out on that ledge, looking down together. It\u2019ll be personal and emotional.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I\u2019m not sure I want to go to Niagara Falls with Leonsis. But I get his point. Given a powerful enough experience, we can get over the barriers to entry (which are lowering every day). Once, you needed a desktop PC and a modem to experience the Internet. Then you got a laptop and Wi-Fi. Now you have a supercomputer in your pocket and can\u2019t imagine life without it. \u201cIt always takes longer for new technology to be socially accepted than what evangelists believe,\u201d Leonsis says. \u201cBut once it takes off, it becomes bigger than anyone imagined. VR will change every industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So think about a special experience you\u2019d love to have\u2014perhaps something expensive, dangerous, or otherwise impossible. Because there\u2019s more than $2 trillion in market capitalization betting that you\u2019ll say yes to wearing the scuba mask.

He claims he hates debt (but his casino companies went bust \u00adbecause of it). He craves press \u00adattention (but sues at the drop of a hat). What does Trump\u2019s record tell us about how he\u2019ll lead?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Donald Trump\u2019s pitch is simple: He is, as he\u2019ll happily tell you, one of the world\u2019s elite businessmen. Therefore he\u2019d make a great President.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Last June, when Trump famously rode down an escalator inside Trump Tower in Manhattan to announce his presidential candidacy to a crowd padded with paid attendees, he delivered a speech that heavily emphasized his 40-year career as a real estate developer and professional personality. (Although most of the headlines focused on his calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe need a leader who wrote <i>The Art of the Deal,<\/i>\u201d he declared, making sure to mention his bestselling 1987 book. \u201cWe need someone who can take the brand of the U.S. and make it great again!\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then, Trump being Trump, he brandished a financial statement, boasting that he\u2019s worth \u201cwell over $10 billion,\u201d and said that the talent for amassing such wealth is \u201cthe kind of thinking we need for this country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Much to the surprise of the political establishment, a good portion of the voting public appears to have bought that argument. Trump has emerged as an unlikely front-runner for the Republican nomination\u2014becoming the first candidate who has never held political office to lead his party\u2019s polls this late in a campaign since lawyer-turned-utility-executive Wendell Willkie challenged F.D.R. in 1940.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">There\u2019s no question that Trump\u2019s perceived business acumen is one of the main drivers of his success. A Bloomberg poll from late last year found that 73% of Republicans think the real estate tycoon \u201cknows how to get things done,\u201d besting all rivals on that measure by a wide margin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But what sort of businessperson is Trump, really? Though he\u2019s been in the public eye for decades, the 69-year-old is arguably better known today for playing an executive on television than for being one in real life. The already famous Trump gained \u00fcber-celebrity status from his starring role as the host of the reality series <i>The Apprentice<\/i> and <i>The Celebrity Apprentice<\/i> for 14 seasons between 2004 and 2015.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read more Fortune coverage of Trump&#8217;s business career:<\/em><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-q-and-a\/\">The Donald Trump Fortune Interview Complete Transcript<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-2\">What Trump Does Have to Teach Leaders<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-atlantic-city-china-sanders\">Donald Trump on Atlantic City, China, and Sanders<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-businessman\">Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know About Trump&#8217;s Business Failures<\/a> (Video)<br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/19\/donald-trump-yellen-fed-debt\">Why Donald Trump Loves Low Interest Rates, But Won&#8217;t Reappoint Janet Yellen<\/a><br \/>\n\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/trump-sanders-trade\">Why Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Are More Similar Than You Think<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The picture is further obscured by Trump\u2019s obsession with promoting his own mystique and the magic of the Donald Trump brand.

He has also profited from an overlooked business in which he thrives\u2014the unglamorous work of overseeing property development and management for other developers. Trump has reaped rich fees in that role on such projects as the current transformation of Washington, D.C.\u2019s historic Old Post Office Building into a luxury hotel, alongside private equity firm Colony Capital. In these ventures, as with his campaign, he keeps his team small and is his own most trusted strategic adviser.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The caricature version of Trump is real. He\u2019s very much the guy who has vowed to force Mexico to pay to build a 50-foot wall on the border. He\u2019s also the man who recently said that women who seek abortions should be subjected to \u201csome form of punishment\u201d\u2014drawing harsh criticism from conservatives and liberals alike. He threw out the idea of a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, then said he would never do it, just threaten it. When he suggested in late March that perhaps Japan should develop nuclear weapons, even unpredictable North Korea was flummoxed\u2014an official called his comments \u201cabsurd and illogical.\u201d And yet the cartoon is not the whole story.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As he marches toward his party\u2019s nomination, the best way to assess how Trump will handle the job of President is to look beyond the daily campaign craziness and closely examine the business career he\u2019s using as his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. (To read what Trump says about his career and his plans for the economy in his own words, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/donald-trump-q-and-a\/\" target=\"_blank\">see our interview here<\/a>.) As the leader of the Free World, how would he lead?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We identified five overriding themes that provide a blueprint for running things the Trump way.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">I.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE ALWAYS COMES FIRST<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_b.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630875\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_b.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=680\" alt=\"Donald Trump at the Grand Opening of Taj Mahal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Trump in 1990 at the opening of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City. He promoted the gambling mecca as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d Later he sold it to his publicly traded company Trump Hotels.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Bettmann\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Over his roller-coaster career, a core part of Trump\u2019s decision-making process can be summarized in four words: Trump always comes first. Whatever the deal, Trump must be the star. He routinely values two things above all, even over making money: being the boss and gaining publicity. No one values the Trump brand higher than Trump himself.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The obsession with seeing his name in lights has at times damaged his public shareholders and Trump himself. \u201cHe lives to see his name praised in the press,\u201d says a former associate who has worked closely with Trump. \u201cWhen it comes to choosing between getting more publicity and making good deals, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a tie.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">One notable case in which his ego swamped his judgment occurred in Atlantic City. In mid-1995 he launched a publicly traded holding company, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, which originally owned one casino in the gambling haven, the Trump Plaza, then purchased the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump\u2019s Castle. In the process, Trump Hotels piled on massive debt. (More on that later.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-25\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"25\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By late 1996, Trump Hotels was struggling, but the company was offered a boost. The Rank Group, owner of the Hard Rock chain, proposed an investment in the Castle that would have helped reverse the declining fortunes at Trump Hotels. Rank, which had just opened a Hard Rock Cafe at the Taj, first discussed purchasing a 50% interest in the Castle for as much as $350 million, valuing the property at $180 million more than Trump paid for it. Rank wanted to rebrand the property simply as the Hard Rock. But at the last minute Trump demanded that his name stay on the property and that it be renamed the Hard Rock at Trump\u2019s Marina. Rank walked, and the stock price of Trump Hotels continued to dive. Trump told <i>Fortune<\/i> that he remembers nothing about any negotiations with Rank.<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px dashed #0071bb;margin:0 35px 35px;padding:1em;color:#ee4123;line-height:1.2em;font-size:1.125em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u201cWhen it comes to choosing between getting more publicity and making good deals, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a tie,\u201d says a former associate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump never likes to sell properties. But he especially hates parting with a building that has his name emblazoned on it. Consider this episode. In 1994, Trump escaped a crippling debt load by selling Riverside South, a huge development site along the Hudson River, to a group from Hong Kong. He managed to keep a 30% stake in the partnership. Over the next decade he oversaw the construction of several Trump-branded apartment towers, with plans for his logo to be spread over a big stretch of western Manhattan. But in 2005 his partners\u2014who had the controlling stake\u2014decided to sell and use the proceeds to purchase two skyscrapers that didn\u2019t carry the Trump name: 1290 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump hated the deal and sued his partners to block it. He argued that the development, bearing the Trump name, was worth about $1 billion more than the price his partners had agreed on. But ironically he later ended up profiting hugely from the transaction. In 2007, Vornado Realty Trust bought out his partners at a price that valued the two buildings at almost $2.6 billion. Trump stayed in the partnership and has seen the value of his stake soar.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">II.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HOW RICH HE IS<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/trump_holdings_010_web.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1630971\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/trump_holdings_010_web.png?w=760&#038;h=721\" alt=\"TRUMP_HOLDINGS_010_WEB\" width=\"760\" height=\"721\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of Trump\u2019s favorite topics is his own net worth, and he\u2019s not satisfied to let the numbers speak for themselves. Much has been made of his statement, under oath in a deposition some years ago, that his own calculation of his wealth changes depending on \u201chow he feels\u201d that day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">One thing that Trump hasn\u2019t felt like doing is release his tax returns, so we can\u2019t know everything about his money. But we have enough information to conclude this: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/02\/donald-trump-tax-returns-income\/?iid=leftrail\" target=\"_blank\">Trump is exaggerating the size of his empire<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On July 15, 2015, Trump filed a personal financial disclosure (PFD) with the Federal Election Commission. The press release that accompanied the disclosure document stated that \u201cas of this date, Mr. Trump\u2019s net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.\u201d (The capitalization is his.) The release also declared that Trump\u2019s income for 2014 was $362 million, \u201cwhich does not include dividends, capital gains, rents, and royalties.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But a close reading of the 92-page document shows that the items that make up that $362 million are actually Trump\u2019s <i>revenues<\/i>, not his income (which would factor in expenses).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That doesn\u2019t imply that Trump is hiding anything, although you would think that a successful businessman would know the difference between revenue and income. Most of the evidence is right there in the filing. But on the basis of his <i>known<\/i> revenues, it\u2019s not plausible that his net worth is $10 billion or more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-26\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"26\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To see why, let\u2019s get into the details. The $362 million figure includes 2014 revenues in 15 buckets\u2014from condo sales to golf \u00adcourses and resorts. The trickiest category is rents, because the information he discloses is incomplete. For smaller properties he reports a range. Let\u2019s grant him the high end, which yields a figure of $46 million. For his bigger buildings, we estimate his total rent at about $130 million a year, based on prevailing rates per square foot. Add up that rent, plus the $362 million, and another $37.5 million in royalties (again, a high-end estimate), and we get a total of $576 million in revenues. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it falls short of a $10 billion enterprise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For perspective, let\u2019s compare Trump\u2019s business to a publicly traded\u2014and therefore transparent\u2014real estate company of roughly the same size. Brandywine Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust that owns more than 179 properties across America, posted revenue of $603 million in 2015\u2014a bit more than our estimate for Trump\u2019s businesses. Today, Brandywine\u2019s market capitalization stands at $2.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>For more on all things Trump, see <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/shawn-tully\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/donald-trump\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Naturally, Trump would argue that the magic of his brand gives him a boost. So let\u2019s assume that Trump\u2019s cachet lifts his operating margins to an industry-best 30%, or well above Brandywine\u2019s 20%. Let\u2019s grant Trump some other generous assumptions\u2014for instance, that he earns a healthy 10% on his $302 million securities portfolio. Factor it all in\u2014and subtract an estimated $40 million a year in interest payments\u2014and <i>Fortune<\/i> ends up with a pretax income estimate of $166 million. If we assume Trump\u2019s businesses are worth 20 times earnings, his empire would be worth about $3.3 billion, or one-third of what he says. (In the chart above, we separately analyzed the values of each of Trump\u2019s holdings and got a higher figure of $3.72 billion. Either way, the total is well short of $10 billion.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump has long used his well-known wealth as a negotiating tool. When creditors threatened to foreclose on him in the early 1990s, Trump claimed his name had such power that taking it off buildings would gravely damage their value. And the tactic worked.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When <i>Fortune<\/i> contacted Trump with our estimate of his wealth, he called to set the record straight. Our income figure is way too low, he insists. \u201cThe $166 mil\u00adlion is peanuts compared to the real number,\u201d says Trump. He says that since he runs a private company, \u201cwe don\u2019t disclose these things,\u201d but that the \u201creal numbers\u201d are four times that big. Boasts the Donald: \u201cWe have 121 licensing deals under negotiation all over the world and the hottest brand anywhere in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump concluded: \u201c<i>Fortune<\/i> has no idea what my assets are or the value of these assets. Nor do they understand or know my cash flow or the many successful transactions that make up my cash flow. <i>Fortune<\/i> has totally lost its way.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">III.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE SUES FIRST, ASKS QUESTIONS LATER<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Trump reads this, will he threaten a lawsuit? It wouldn\u2019t be surprising. In 1984 he sued a <i>Chicago Tribune<\/i> architecture critic for $500 million after the writer criticized Trump\u2019s plan to build a skyscraper in lower Manhattan. (The case was dismissed.) In 2006, Trump sued Tim O\u2019Brien, author of <i>TrumpNation,<\/i> for $5 billion for suggesting that Trump\u2019s net worth was lower than he claimed. (An appeals court later ruled for O\u2019Brien.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s a pattern that goes way back. In 1973, Trump, then 27, moved from Queens, where he grew up, across the East River to the glitz and glory of Manhattan. He joined an exclusive East Side nightclub called Le Club, where he soon met and befriended the notorious lawyer, power broker, and fixer Roy Cohn. A red- and gay-baiter in the 1950s, when he served as chief counsel to Sen. Joseph \u00adMcCarthy, Cohn was famously in-your-face. Cohn was eventually disbarred for fraud and other serious wrongdoing, but not until July 1986, a month before his death, at age 59, from complications of AIDS.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:70%;margin-left:15%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_c.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630876\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_c.jpg?w=900&#038;h=1455\" alt=\"Donald Trump Announces Trump University\" width=\"900\" height=\"1455\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Trump, standing in front of a picture of Trump, shows off a Trump book at the launch of Trump University in May 2005.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Mario Tama\u2014Getty Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">When Trump Management ran into trouble in 1973, Trump, then president of the company, turned to Cohn. Trump Management, built by Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump, rented about 14,000 residential units in 39 buildings in Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, according to contemporaneous accounts in the <i>New York Times.<\/i> In October 1973 the government accused the company of discriminating on the basis of race and color in its rental policies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump denied the \u00adcharges, insisting that the government was trying to force his company to rent to welfare recipients. In December 1973, Cohn filed a $100 million counterclaim\u2014a staggering sum in 1973\u2014against the government for defamation. A federal judge struck the counterclaim just five weeks later. In 1975, Trump settled the suit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">However, Cohn\u2019s shocking 1973 counterclaim\u2014a legally far-fetched, media-grabbing shot over the bow announcing that Trump would spare no expense to impose costs on \u00adcritics\u2014provided a template for attacks, which have become a mainstay of Trump\u2019s business arsenal ever since.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-29f2e23199a664ee1b64bdd7bfb338c64b3019e3\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.knightlab.com\/libs\/timeline3\/latest\/embed\/index.html?source=1FiFCu6Z2Em8ObOK24tKzAJuHeogk6jRA9pKu4dKcA8c&#038;font=Default&#038;lang=en&#038;initial_zoom=2&#038;height=800&#038;iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-29f2e23199a664ee1b64bdd7bfb338c64b3019e3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump explained the strategy to journalist William D.

I do it because at least you can inflict pain that way on somebody, in terms of legal fees and other things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump himself is currently the target of litigation. And out on the stump he has vowed that if elected, he will \u201copen up our libel laws,\u201d effectively overturning the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1964 ruling in <i>New York Times<\/i> v.

As evidence, he claims that the businesses he runs have \u201cvery low debt and tremendous cash flow.\u201d That example, Trump has declared, demonstrates \u201cthe kind of thinking this country needs, with $19 trillion in debt, believe me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But a close examination of how Trump ran one of America\u2019s biggest gaming enterprises demonstrates an entirely different kind of thinking from the belt-tightening rhetoric he spouts on the campaign trail. In fact, Trump has a record of recklessly piling on debt\u2014with disastrous results.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump served as chairman and sometimes CEO of publicly traded Trump Hotels, later renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 to its second bankruptcy, in early 2009. Over that period he leveraged his gaming properties to such heights that he gravely impaired their prospects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When Trump Hotels first went public in 1995, its big holding was a single casino: the Trump Plaza. Early the following year, Trump Hotels bought the Trump Taj Mahal, billed as the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World,\u201d for $898 million. In the transaction, Trump Hotels took on a lot of really expensive debt\u2014$817 million in junk bond borrowings at 11.25% interest. From the start, the Taj was losing \u00admoney because of its big interest burden. \u201cPeople will be shocked when they hear the numbers. The numbers are just huge,\u201d said Trump at the time, hyping the merger.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_d.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630877\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_d.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=634\" alt=\"Nordaby and Demidio, of Calvi Electric, remove the letter 'A' from the signage of Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey\" width=\"1024\" height=\"634\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Workers remove letters from a sign on Atlantic City\u2019s Trump Plaza Casino shortly after it shut down in 2014.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Mark Makela\u2014Reuters<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Trump wasn\u2019t done buying casinos\u2014from Trump. In June 1996 he announced the purchase of another of his casinos, Trump\u2019s Castle. Whereas he\u2019d held just half the equity in the Taj, he owned 100% of the Castle. Trump Hotels agreed to buy the Castle for about $520 million\u2014and Trump gave himself a premium. The announced price was a staggering 18 times cash flow (twice what the Taj had fetched). It\u2019s not even clear the Castle was worth its debt load of over $350 million.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It didn\u2019t take long for the debt to take its toll. When Trump Hotels went public, it had carried just $494 million in long-term debt; by the end of the next year, after the two big purchases, its borrowings had ballooned to $1.7 billion. By 2002, Trump Hotels\u2019 debt was $2.1 billion, and its leverage ratio had expanded to 27, approaching the levels that sank Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">From its IPO in 1995 through two separate bankruptcies in 2004 and 2009, Trump Hotels\u2014and its successor, Trump Entertainment\u2014never made money. Year after year its operating profits were decimated by gigantic interest costs. Over the almost 15 years that Trump served as chairman, the casino company posted net losses, excluding extraordinary items, totaling nearly $1.7 billion.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:17px solid #0071bb;\" \/>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold MT';font-weight:bold;font-size:3em;margin:0;text-align:center;color:#ee4123;\">V.<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"border-bottom:1px dashed #0071bb;padding:.5em 0;margin:0 35px 52px;font-size:.875em;font-variant:small-caps;letter-spacing:.1em;line-height:1.3em;text-align:center;\">HE THINKS HE&#8217;S GREAT AT EVERYTHING<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike most real estate titans, Trump has never stuck to real estate. He has frequently attempted to acquire and operate companies in industries outside his expertise. Several executives who worked for Trump, all of whom declined to speak on the record because they fear his wrath, say they were constantly warned by managers who knew him best that \u201cDonald\u2019s ego is so big, he believes he can run anything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1630711-28\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"28\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the late 1980s, Trump bought the Plaza Hotel and the former Eastern Shuttle (renaming it Trump Shuttle), then lost both businesses to excessive debt and weak management. He also led abortive takeovers of Bally and American Airlines. His buccaneering style was especially misplaced in gambling, an industry that\u2019s extremely cyclical. While his rival Steve Wynn stuck to gaming and retrenched when he anticipated downturns, Trump never thought Atlantic City would do anything but boom\u2014failing to foresee the threat from the spread of gaming to neighboring states.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The same approach is evident in Trump\u2019s latest quest in politics. He clearly thinks he\u2019s not just the best candidate for the job but also the best at running a major presidential campaign. \u201cI\u2019m the strategist,\u201d he recently bragged to <i>New York<\/i> magazine, explaining that he has been the architect of his unorthodox campaign and unexpected political success. Once again, though, Trump might not know quite as much as he thinks he does. Pundits are predicting that his ineptitude in the intricacies of the process\u2014especially in securing delegates\u2014could potentially cost him the nomination at the Republican convention. Then Trump could go back to the business of being Trump full-time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune.<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"April 21, 2016","published":"2016-04-21 06:30:43","updated":"2016-04-21 06:30:43","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"Business the Trump Way","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/tru05_a.jpg?w=1024","class":"featured-img-image","credit":"Above photo by Gillian Laub\u2014Contour by Getty Images","caption":"Businessman Donald Trump is photographed in his office","attach_id":"1630874"},"excerpt":"<p>What does his record say about how he\u2019ll lead? <\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1630741","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/shawn-tully-and-roger-parloff\/","name":"Shawn Tully and Roger Parloff","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"What does his record say about how he\u2019ll lead?","seo":{"seo_title":"Business the Donald Trump Way","seo_description":"What does Donald Trump's business record say about how he\u2019ll lead the United States?","seo_keywords":"donald trump, election 2016, donald trump net worth, trump hotels, donald trump businesses, donald trump career, donald trump lawsuits, trump presidential campaign, trump businessman","seo_news_keywords":"donald trump, election 2016, donald trump net worth, trump hotels, donald trump businesses, donald trump career, donald trump lawsuits, trump presidential campaign, trump businessman","seo_additional_meta":"<meta name=\"standout\" content=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\" \/>"},"social":{"url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2Fdonald-trump-businessman%2F","shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/20Xomsz","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F20Xomsz","encoded_title":"Business+the+Trump+Way","twitter_text":"Business the Trump way","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"What does his record say about how he\u2019ll lead?","facebook_title":"Business the Trump Way"}},{"id":1632956,"content_type":"free full","is_magazine_content":"magazine","url":"\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","title":"Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Half-Billion-Dollar Noodle Debacle in India","content":"<h1 style=\"font-size:2.5em;margin:0 10px 52px;color:#ed1b2e;text-align:center;line-height:1.125em;\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Half-Billion-Dollar Noodle Debacle in India<\/h1>\n<h2 style=\"font-size:1.25em;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.25em;margin:0 10px 35px;\"><em>Nestl\u00e9 spent three decades building a beloved noodle brand in India. Then the world\u2019s biggest food and beverage company stumbled into a public relations debacle that cost it half a billion dollars. A cautionary tale of mangled crisis management on an epic scale.<\/em><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was the middle of the night when the jangle of his cellphone woke Sanjay Khajuria from a deep sleep. In the few seconds it took him to get his bearings\u2014to remember he was in a Manhattan hotel room and not at home in his bed in Delhi\u2014the Nestl\u00e9 executive had an unsettling thought: Could this be about Maggi?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria is not accustomed to receiving urgent, late-night phone calls. As head of corporate affairs for Nestl\u00e9 India, he typically divides his time between handling routine regulatory issues and trumpeting the company\u2019s achievements in \u201ccreating shared value\u201d\u2014the approach to corporate social responsibility that Nestl\u00e9 espouses. In fact, Khajuria, 51, was in New York to represent his company in a shared value leadership summit, for which Nestl\u00e9 was a sponsor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Virtually everything in his world had appeared to be in order when he boarded his flight to New York. There was just one pesky issue to clear up. Health officials in one of India\u2019s 29 states had raised questions after testing a sample of one of Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s bestselling products: Maggi 2-Minute Noodles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food and beverage company, has sold Maggi (pronounced \u201cMAG-ee\u201d) in India for more than 30 years, and the brand\u2019s ubiquity and cultural resonance on the subcontinent is something akin to Coca-Cola\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ko\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola-63\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ko<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> in the U.S. \u2009In 2014, Indians consumed more than 400,000 tons of the instant noodles\u2014marketed in 10 varieties, from Thrillin\u2019 Curry to Cuppa Mania Masala Yo!\u2014and Maggi accounted for roughly a quarter of the company\u2019s $1.6 billion in revenue in the country. That year Maggi was named one of India\u2019s five most trusted brands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/sanjay-khajuria.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636113\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/sanjay-khajuria.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Sanjay Khajuria stands at the Maggi display in Nestle's Indian headquarters in Gurgaon.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Sanjay Khajuria stands near the Maggi display in Nestl\u00e9 India&#8217;s headquarters in Gurgaon. <\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria\u2019s team had received the regulatory notice about Maggi 10 days earlier. The food-safety commissioner of Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, with 205 million people, was claiming that a package of the noodles had been found to contain seven times the permissible level of lead and had recalled the batch. Nestl\u00e9 India had quickly responded with test results of its own showing that its noodles were absolutely safe. Khajuria expected that officials would find his company\u2019s response compelling and that the issue would soon be resolved. But why was someone trying to reach him at such a late hour?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">He reached for his phone and answered the call. It wasn\u2019t good news. Khajuria\u2019s colleagues back at home informed him that a widely read Hindi language newspaper had reported the news about the health notice. More alarming: The article suggested that state officials would soon recommend that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the country\u2019s central regulator, should ban Maggi nationwide.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria spent the next hour on the phone formulating a game plan. Nestl\u00e9 would respond to media requests but not yet issue a public statement. And it would send a three-person delegation to meet directly with the health officials in Uttar Pradesh the following day. At this point, allows Khajuria, he was starting to get worried.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-29\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"29\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When he hung up, he couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. It was May 11, 2015.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">What had at first seemed like a minor regulatory annoyance was about to spiral into a crisis of epic proportions for Nestl\u00e9. Within a week the first national news story about a Maggi health scare appeared in the <i>Times of India<\/i>. A couple of days later the hashtag #MaggiBan surfaced on Twitter. Then things got worse.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On June 5, 2015, less than a month after Khajuria\u2019s phone rang in the middle of the night, India\u2019s central food regulator announced a temporary ban on the manufacture, sale, and distribution of Maggi noodles. In its order the FSSAI pronounced Maggi \u201cunsafe and hazardous for human consumption,\u201d a designation supported by 30 government lab tests showing Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles contained excess amounts of lead.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_e.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634609\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_e.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=673\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles are often served by vendors at \u201cMaggi points.\u201d<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Kuni Takahashi\u2014Bloomberg via Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Enraged consumers wasted no time venting their anger. In some cities protesters in the street smashed and set fire to packs of noodles and photos of Bollywood stars who were paid Maggi endorsers. One prominent newscaster compared the situation to Bhopal, the worst industrial accident of all time, in which a toxic gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in central India killed thousands of people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Maggi meltdown would prove costly. Nestl\u00e9 lost at least $277 million in missed sales. Another $70 million was spent to execute one of the largest food recalls in history. Add the damage to its brand value\u2014which one consultancy pegged at $200 million\u2014and the total price tag for the debacle could easily be more than half a billion dollars. And the fallout continues.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-print-charts.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636858\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-print-charts.png?w=760&#038;h=365\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.print-charts\" width=\"760\" height=\"365\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nearly a year after the ban, Maggi noodles are back on shelves in India, but somewhat precariously so. The product\u2019s future depends on two legal cases that are working their way through the Indian court system. Both pit Nestl\u00e9 against the Indian government.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9, meanwhile, is still struggling to make sense of what exactly transpired. To counter the accusations of Indian health officials, Nestl\u00e9 has produced voluminous tests\u2014on more than 3,500 samples\u2014that it says show its instant noodles are perfectly safe, with lead counts well below the legal limit. For a 150-year-old Swiss business that brands itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s leading nutrition, health, and wellness company,\u201d the idea that it fell short on quality control\u2014especially regarding a substance with such dire health effects\u2014is anathema. But where, then, did things go so terribly wrong?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-map.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636633\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-map.png?w=760&#038;h=870\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.map\" width=\"760\" height=\"870\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-photosplit.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636857\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-photosplit.png?w=760&#038;h=182\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.photosplit\" width=\"760\" height=\"182\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This is a story about precisely that: What happens when a $100 billion global giant suddenly finds itself in a crisis\u2014and everything it does to get out of it only sinks the company further into the morass? It\u2019s an epic narrative of a powerful corporation brought low by an obscure food-safety agency in India and a handful of local government functionaries. And it\u2019s a case study in irony about a company that, after a humiliating and existential scandal over infant formula, tried to reinvent itself as a paragon of corporate do-gooding and transparency\u2014only to discover that no matter what positive, world-bettering things it did, it couldn\u2019t quite escape its tainted past.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s also a cautionary tale about a towering multinational utterly losing its way in one of the world\u2019s most sought-after markets\u2014India\u2014which, as it happens, has chewed up and spit out a number of mighty names in the past. Coca-Cola left the country in 1977 after being asked to hand over its secret formula\u2014only to return decades later and get banned again, briefly, when pesticides were found in its soda. Walmart <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"wmt\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart-1\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">wmt<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> scaled back its ambitious plans in India in 2013 when it realized it couldn\u2019t possibly comply with regulations requiring 30% of its products to be sourced from small Indian businesses. Just recently Facebook tasted its own frustration when, in February, Indian regulators rejected its Free Basics web access program. This is the regulatory thicket that pro-business Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to untangle\u2014and that still seems as impenetrable as ever.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_f.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634611\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_f.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=751\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"751\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">In June 2015, after reports of lead contamination, outraged consumers set fire to packs of Maggi.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: EPA\/Corbis<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Despite Nestl\u00e9\u2019s long history in India, the company\u2019s executives managed to misread a fast-moving situation at every point. And in that sense the Maggi episode is certain to be studied by MBA students and public relations executives looking for lessons for years to come.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThis is a case where you can be so right and yet so wrong,\u201d says Nestl\u00e9 CEO Paul Bulcke. \u201cWe were right on factual arguments and yet so wrong on arguing. It\u2019s not a matter of being right. It\u2019s a matter of engaging the right way and finding a solution.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe live in an ambiguous world. We have to be able to cope with that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To understand why Nestl\u00e9 failed so spectacularly in this instance, it helps to go back to where the saga started.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">A Surprising Test Result<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Sanjay Singh bent down and plucked a four-pack of masala-flavored Maggi noodles from a low shelf at Easyday, a well-maintained mini-mart on the western edge of Barabanki. It was a Monday morning in March 2014. As one of five food inspectors in Barabanki, a rough-and-tumble town of 150,000 in central Uttar Pradesh, Singh, 40, typically spends most of his time cracking down on street and festival vendors, like the biryani rice peddler who was spiking his product with an illegal yellow coloring.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But on this day he was following orders from the top: The food-safety commissioner of Uttar Pradesh had called on officers to spend the week raiding supermarkets. The exercise was in preparation for Holi, a spring celebration in which revelers throw colored powders and gorge on snacks. The Easyday, just across the road from Singh\u2019s office and one outlet in a chain that had originally been co-owned by Walmart, was the inspector\u2019s first stop that morning. Singh was intrigued by the no added msg label on the bright-yellow package of noodles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_g.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634614\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_g.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=681\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Food-safety officer Sanjay Singh in the Easyday store in Barabanki, where he first collected a Maggi package for testing in March 2014, kicking off a national scandal.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Like most Indians, Singh was familiar with Maggi. His daughter liked to eat the instant noodles, which are sold in a plastic bag containing two components: a patty of deep-fried noodles, plus the \u201ctastemaker\u201d packet of spices (the same basic components as the ramen noodle packs that are a staple of the diet of college kids in the U.S.). Per standard procedure, Singh sent off one of the four Maggi packages to a laboratory across the state in Gorakhpur for testing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The results, which arrived a few weeks later, surprised the inspector. The Maggi sample had tested positive for MSG, or monosodium glutamate, a controversial ingredient that\u2019s legal in India but requires disclosure and a warning that the product is not recommended for children under 12 months old. A flavor enhancer often associated with Chinese food, MSG has for decades been blamed for everything from bad dreams to cancer\u2014all claims that research has failed to substantiate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-30\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"30\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The fact that the Maggi sample contained MSG when its packaging said it didn\u2019t was a violation punishable with a fine of up to 300,000 rupees\u2014or about $4,500. Had Nestl\u00e9 paid the penalty, this story might have ended there.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But when Nestl\u00e9 India was notified, the company denied adding MSG and appealed the finding. As a result, in June 2014, a second Maggi sample was sent to a different government laboratory more than 600 miles away in Kolkata. After a bizarrely long delay\u2014one that has helped fuel conspiracy theories\u2014the narrative would take a more serious turn.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">An Earthshaking Development<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Nearly a year later, in April 2015, Singh was at the office when the lab report on the second sample finally came back from Kolkata. In a very Indian twist, it had somehow gotten lost in the mail on its way to Kolkata for a period of months\u2014in the process taking a 1,200-mile detour through the Himalayas\u2014and once at the lab, it had apparently ended up at the bottom of a pile.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Singh skimmed the first page of the report and noted that despite the long time gap, everything appeared to be in order. The sample had arrived with the packet seals intact, and the test results were signed and stamped by the director of the lab. He flipped ahead to see whether MSG had shown up again. And, yes, there it was. \u201cMSG: Present.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This report was far more comprehensive than the first one. Singh, an organic chemistry Ph.D., continued methodically down the page until his eye landed on \u201cLead: 17.2 ppm.\u201d Could it really be 17.2 parts per million?<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:35px;\" align=\"center\"><iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-0a87f30ac55300593d1a22e3ac27ca89eac4d932\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.knightlab.com\/libs\/timeline3\/latest\/embed\/index.html?source=1NfIbqjF9sM_L0nni5osxypkRaben8Mz_rRSAdqXAMoE&#038;font=Default&#038;lang=en&#038;initial_zoom=2&#038;height=900&#038;iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-0a87f30ac55300593d1a22e3ac27ca89eac4d932\" width=\"100%\" height=\"650\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">He read it again, stunned. According to the report, the Maggi sample contained more than seven times the permissible level of lead\u2014over 1,000 times more than the company claimed was in the product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Lead is naturally present in small concentrations in air, water, and soil, and so it\u2019s expected that trace amounts show up in the food supply. But this was not a trace amount. And significant exposure to lead causes wide-ranging and serious health effects, particularly in children.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Two days later Singh and his colleagues made another morning raid at the Easyday. This time the purpose was to suspend the store\u2019s license for selling substandard food and to collect any tainted noodles. But there was no stock to seize. The Maggi sample that tested positive for lead was from a batch that was long gone from shelves.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As the food officers spoke with the store manager, the earth started to shake violently. They all scrambled for cover as packages tumbled from the shelves. When the shaking stopped, they joked that the earthquake\u2014which they would later discover had killed thousands of people in neighboring Nepal\u2014was the \u201cBoom!\u201d of giant Nestl\u00e9 falling to the ground.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636183\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/noodle-break-c.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=255\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.Maggi.Noodle.02\" width=\"1024\" height=\"255\" \/> <span class=\"credit\">Photograph by The Voorhes for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Polite Superiority<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The headquarters of Nestl\u00e9 India is a five-story, glass-walled building that sits along an eight-lane expressway in Gurgaon, a commercial district about 30 minutes outside central Delhi. Though it\u2019s situated in the middle of a sleek, urban area, cows still occasionally meander across Nestl\u00e9 House\u2019s front lawn.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 began doing business in India in 1912. Today the Swiss parent company owns 63% of Nestl\u00e9 India, which trades separately on the Indian stock exchange. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s operations in India encompass eight factories, an R&amp;D facility focused on developing products for the Indian palate, and more than 7,000 employees.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-maggi-stock.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636666\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-maggi-stock.png?w=1000&#038;h=625\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Click to enlarge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Kolkata lab report arrived in the mail at Nestl\u00e9 House on May 1, 2015, along with a notice from the food-safety commissioner of Uttar Pradesh, and landed on the desk of technical director Aris Protonotarios, the man in charge of quality and safety at Nestl\u00e9 India. A soft-spoken Greek, Protonotarios has spent more than a quarter of a century with Nestl\u00e9. His confidence in his company\u2019s quality assurance systems is such that, he says, he didn\u2019t consider for a minute that any packages of Maggi could have left a factory with lead in them. \u201cTo anyone at Nestl\u00e9, being told your product is unsafe and hazardous is an insult,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me it felt personal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 can trace that attitude all the way back to founder Henri Nestl\u00e9, a self-described \u201cmerchant chemist\u201d who started a company bearing his name in 1866 and was said to obsess over quality. Today Nestl\u00e9 is one of the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable corporations, with some 335,000 employees, and products sold in every country around the world.

The multinational has a deep roster of potent brands\u2014including Kit Kat, Nescaf\u00e9, Stouffer\u2019s, and, of course, Maggi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-inida-lab.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636107\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nestle-inida-lab.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Nestle chemists analyze Maggi samples at their Quality Assurance Center in Moga, India.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Nestle India<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Maggi is actually one of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s oldest and largest global brands. It originated in 1863 when Julius Maggi, a Swiss industrialist looking to improve the nutrition of the nation\u2019s workforce, developed condensed pea and bean soups. Maggi\u2019s seasonings, soups, and noodles are now sold in 101 countries.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">People hardly even ate noodles in India when Nestl\u00e9 introduced Maggi in 1983. But the masala spice mix made the taste familiar, and the two-rupee price point made it widely affordable. Marketed to time-pressed mothers\u2014\u201cMummy, I\u2019m hungry\u201d went the product\u2019s popular jingle\u2014Maggi soared to popularity as a children\u2019s snack. Soon it was mainstream comfort food and \u201cMaggi points\u201d\u2014stands at which vendors cook up noodles to order\u2014proliferated.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By 2015, Nestl\u00e9 was manufacturing Maggi at five of its eight Indian factories. Protonotarios says that lead is among the many safety hazards around which Nestl\u00e9 designs its quality assurance system: Each factory regularly checks raw materials, its water supply, and packaging for lead. Nestl\u00e9 India also tests its finished product at each factory every six months, as required by India\u2019s regulations. \u201cThe monitoring process would have picked up something if it wasn\u2019t okay,\u201d says Protonotarios matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd if it had, we would have done something about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-31\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"31\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A check of its records showed no irregularities. So Nestl\u00e9 India prepared a stack of its internal monitoring documents and mailed a response to the Uttar Pradesh food-safety officials on May 5. The company advised the state regulator that, based on its review, no further action should be taken in the case.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In retrospect, it was a stunningly dismissive reaction\u2014and one that would provide a blueprint for more drama to come. Because of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s inherent confidence in its own processes and data, it couldn\u2019t imagine that it might have a problem on its hands. That attitude of detached if polite superiority would irritate officials and exacerbate Nestl\u00e9\u2019s problems, especially when the Indian press got wind of the story.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">\u201cWe Just Had No Control\u201d<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">If the media environment in the U.S. seems overhyped at times, it is downright somnambulant compared with the round-the-clock free-for-all on the subcontinent. India has nearly 400 news networks, and the country\u2019s news debate programs often feature up to eight talking heads on a screen at once. The Maggi controversy would soon became fodder for hours of lively, breathless punditry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The evolution from local issue to national debate was blindingly fast. On May 7, two days after Nestl\u00e9 India sent its response to the health officials, the first stories about problems with Maggi noodles began to appear in Hindi language news coverage in Uttar Pradesh. Shortly after that, employees in Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s social media command center began to notice comments about tainted noodles on Twitter and Maggi\u2019s Facebook page. Khajuria received his late-night phone call in New York on May 11. Within a week speculation about a Maggi ban was everywhere. Yet Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t issue a statement on the matter until May 21, when it asserted that there was \u201cno order to recall Maggi Noodles being sold\u201d and that the product was \u201csafe to eat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_h.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634617\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_h.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=681\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Employees in Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s \u201cdigital acceleration\u201d room monitor social media.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Why wasn\u2019t Nestl\u00e9 more proactive? Partly because, as a general rule, the Nestl\u00e9 way is to deal with authorities directly rather than through the press. Nestl\u00e9 India execs also say they were still gathering facts and doing as much testing of their own as possible. But what\u2019s the use of data if you don\u2019t explain yourself?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">While Nestl\u00e9 stayed mostly quiet, the story metastasized. One of the first days Maggi made news, Maarten Geraets, Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s head of foods, sat down in front of a TV in the company\u2019s boardroom to see what was being said. It was nonstop and not kind; as he flipped channels, he was seized with horror and utter frustration. The Maggi news was on every channel. \u201cWe just had no control.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To outsiders, too, Nestl\u00e9 appeared paralyzed\u2014or worse, guilty. Many Indians took the company\u2019s silence as a sign of wrongdoing. The bigger the story got, the more scattered the coverage became. Some reports focused on \u201cdangerous\u201d MSG, while others focused on lead. Rumors spread in the hinterlands that Maggi contained glass particles\u2014a mix-up due to the linguistic similarity of the words \u201clead\u201d and \u201cglass\u201d in Hindi.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The escalating media attention also put pressure on another entity: the FSSAI, India\u2019s national food regulator. That put a spotlight on Yudhvir Singh Malik, a career civil servant and the FSSAI\u2019s CEO for just half a year when the Maggi scandal broke. In his short tenure he had already tangled with multinationals over labeling and quality issues. However, Nestl\u00e9 was a reputable global company, and the evidence against it was limited to two samples, one of which had taken an unusually long journey to the lab. He decided that more investigation was needed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_k.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634624\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_k.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Yudhveer Singh Malik, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">\u009a Yudhvir Singh Malik, then CEO of India\u2019s central food regulator, the day before he temporarily banned Maggi from shelves in June 2015.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jyoti Kapoor\u2014Solaris Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On May 25, Malik wrote to the state food-safety commissioners\u2014each of India\u2019s 29 states and seven union territories has its own fully empowered food and drug regulator\u2014asking that they test Maggi and submit findings to the FSSAI by June 1. Officials across the nation dispatched inspectors to grab Maggi packets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By this time Nestl\u00e9\u2019s leadership team in Switzerland was beginning to grasp that something in India was not unfolding as the team\u2019s data said it should.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">From \u201cTechnical Matter\u201d to Crisis<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">For one of the world\u2019s largest consumer-facing companies, Nestl\u00e9 operates at a surprising remove, beginning with its geography. \u201cThe Centre\u201d\u2014as its global headquarters is known\u2014is not near a major hub but in Vevey, a sleepy town of 18,000 on the northern shore of Lake Geneva.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Other than through its marketing, Nestl\u00e9 hasn\u2019t traditionally engaged much with the wider world. It doesn\u2019t generally seek media attention, and its communications department is tiny relative to its size. Until three years ago, Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t have a centralized PR team in the U.S., its largest market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Chalk it up partly to a natural Swiss reserve, but Nestl\u00e9\u2019s aloofness also has to do with the long shadow cast by the company\u2019s notorious baby formula scandal. In 1974 a non-profit called War on Want published a 12-page pamphlet called <i>The Baby Killer<\/i> that excoriated the formula industry for its marketing tactics. In pushing their products over breast-feeding, the document alleged, companies like Nestl\u00e9 had led to the malnourishment and deaths of countless \u201cthird world babies.\u201d The entire industry was targeted, but Nestl\u00e9, as the largest formula company, took the biggest hit. A high-profile boycott of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s products ensued. The company tried many things to stem the criticism, to little avail.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s executives lost their appetite for broad public engagement. \u201cThey felt very quickly attacked,\u201d says Albert Pfiffner, the company\u2019s historian. \u201cIt has taken a generation to overcome this feeling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">During the past decade Nestl\u00e9 has embraced a version of corporate civic duty that is in keeping with its reserved culture: creating shared value, or CSV. The philosophy is that building a sustainable business naturally generates positive social by-products. Why bother with one-off charitable initiatives when you can simply invest for the long term? Today Nestl\u00e9 execs talk about their business almost exclusively through the prism of CSV. The company\u2019s 2015 CSV report, which tracks the company\u2019s 39 societal commitments, from \u201cdelivering nutrition information and advice on all our labels\u201d to \u201cworking against corruption and bribery,\u201d was 351 pages; its annual financial report was 176.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636186\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/noodle-break-3.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=255\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16.Maggi.Noodle.05\" width=\"1024\" height=\"255\" \/><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by The Voorhes for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">From his spare, elegant office in the Centre, Bulcke presides over his global business empire with a sort of mathematical laissez-faire, trusting his company\u2019s chain of command. A lanky, blue-eyed Belgian fluent in six languages, the 61-year-old joined Nestl\u00e9 in 1979 and became CEO in 2008. (He was a surprise pick over Paul Polman, who is now Unilever\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ul\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ul\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ul<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> CEO.) Bulcke knows that a company the size of Nestl\u00e9 is bound to run into controversy now and again. That explains his favorite aphorism: Tall trees catch more wind.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When he first heard about the Maggi case, says Bulcke, it struck him as a straightforward technical matter involving testing methods that could be judged and handled by his capable people in the field. \u201cIt was a \u2018What is your spectrometer setting?\u2019 sort of thing,\u201d Bulcke tells me. He says now he was \u201ctoo Cartesian\u201d in his thinking.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By the end of May, his communications team was sounding the alarm that the story was exploding. As he listened to a Maggi crisis conference call on June 2, a couple of things became clear to Bulcke: He had badly miscalculated, and it was time for him to jump in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou feel it,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the morale of the troops, you\u2019ve got to show your nose.\u201d He left for India the next day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">The CEO\u2019s Terrible 24 Hours<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">When Bulcke arrived in India on June 4, he found his top managers preparing to visit the FSSAI. The regulator had called at 10:30 that morning and asked them to come to a meeting at 1 p.m. \u2009The executives were unclear on the agenda, but they didn\u2019t think that Bulcke should go. They feared he was \u201ctoo senior.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke has a breezy, authoritative demeanor, and he dismissed any such notion. \u201cCome on, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px solid #ed1b2e;margin:0 35px 35px;line-height:1.125em;padding:1em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.125em;\">\u201cThis is a case where you can be so right and yet so wrong. We were right on factual arguments and yet so wrong on arguing.\u201d <span style=\"font-size:.875em;color:#ed1b2e;\">\u2014<em>Paul Bulcke<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke and his team arrived and sat down across a conference room table from Malik and another FSSAI official. The mood was tense. Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s team complained it had not received test reports from the states and argued that tests were being done improperly. Malik fired back that Nestl\u00e9 would have to ask the states for their test results and that their procedures were proper.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As he listened, Bulcke realized how far apart the two sides were. Looking back, he compares the meeting to watching a house burn down while two firefighters argue over the fire\u2019s cause.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sensing the regulator might do something drastic, Bulcke says he decided what to do almost on the spot: Nestl\u00e9 needed to launch a voluntary recall and pull every variety of Maggi off the shelves.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;float:right;width:40%;margin-left:25px;margin-right:10px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_i.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1634619\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_i.jpg?w=367&#038;h=464\" alt=\"Paul Bulcke, Nestle, Maggie Noodles\" width=\"367\" height=\"464\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Nestl\u00e9 CEO Paul Bulcke<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jyoti Kapoor\u2014Solaris Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">His resolve was bolstered that afternoon when states began to ban the noodles. The first ban came from Uttarakhand, a state in northern India, where Nestl\u00e9 had one of its five Maggi factories. Bans in five other states and territories quickly followed\u2014including Delhi, the one that contains the national capital.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke gathered his management team in Nestl\u00e9 House\u2019s fifth-floor boardroom and explained his thinking. Nestl\u00e9 had lost the regulators and had lost the media. The only way to regain control of the narrative\u2014and win back consumers\u2019 trust\u2014would be to pull Maggi and relaunch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Executing the recall would be a gargantuan task. The product they were recalling was in 3.5 million outlets. Plus, it was India, with all its red tape. Each of the 29 states is like its own country, meaning that trucks have to stop at each border for inspection. Vehicles can enter cities only during certain hours, and to do so they must be a certain size. Even with 38 distribution centers across the country, some of Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s products take 13 days to get to market. The company would need to reverse-engineer this process. And it would have to do something with all those noodles. Nevertheless, Bulcke was determined about the course of action.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 set a press conference for noon the next day to announce the news, and at 12:30 a.m. the company sent a short statement to the Indian stock exchange: \u201cIn spite of Maggi noodles being safe, Nestl\u00e9 India decides to take the product off shelves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Khajuria notified Malik a short while later by text: \u201cWe have decided to take Maggi noodles off shelves.\u201d Bulcke went to his hotel and, he says, \u201cgot a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">An Uphill Journey Begins<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The head of the FSSAI was not satisfied with the developments. Though Maggi would be pulled from the market, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s press statement insisted on the product\u2019s safety. Meanwhile, he had mounting evidence from labs around the country indicating otherwise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So the regulator countered Nestl\u00e9\u2019s move by implementing a temporary national ban of Maggi.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Aware of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s 12 p.m. press event, Malik punched out an eight-page order calling on Nestl\u00e9 to respond within 15 days with a reason that product approval for all varieties of Maggi noodles should not be revoked. He fired it off to Nestl\u00e9 India by email at 11:15 a.m., and the news broke while Bulcke was meeting the media.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The press conference took place in a high-ceilinged hall in Delhi\u2019s Oberoi Hotel. Despite the short notice, journalists packed the room, and Indian news channels broke into their programming to air the CEO\u2019s remarks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_j.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634622\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_j.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=482\" alt=\"Paul Bulcke, Nestle, Maggi Noodles\" width=\"1024\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">At a tense press conference in Delhi on June 5, 2015, Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke explained the decision to recall Maggi.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Ajay Agarwal\u2014Hindustan Times via Getty Images<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke kept his opening comments to five minutes and a few key points: Maggi is safe; consumer trust has been shaken by unfounded concerns; we\u2019re working with authorities; we are committed to India.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Then the floor was opened up to questions, and the room erupted as the 200 journalists demanded answers from Bulcke: Why had it taken Nestl\u00e9 two weeks to make a statement? If Maggi was safe, was he saying the government labs were wrong? No, he replied, he wasn\u2019t criticizing the government\u2019s science. For 45 minutes he gulped Perrier from a goblet and managed to keep his cool.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Bulcke flew out later that evening. He had been in India for roughly 24 hours, and things had seemingly gone from bad to worse. But the CEO left the country feeling happy and confident that things were about to turn around: \u201cIt was the first step of an uphill journey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">We\u2019ll Settle This in Court<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The next step would be played out in the courts. The FSSAI had given Nestl\u00e9 India 15 days to respond to its order, which threatened the company with permanent loss of Maggi\u2019s product approvals. Responding with an explanation was one option; suing was another.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Filing suit against the FSSAI, the agency that regulated not just Maggi but also Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s many other products, was risky. But six words in the FSSAI order were especially troubling to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s executives: \u201cunsafe and hazardous for human consumption.\u201d They felt the phrase exposed them to legal action. Millions of people in India ate Maggi. What was to stop anyone who had health problems from blaming Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On June 11, six days after the government issued its temporary ban, Nestl\u00e9 India filed suit against the FSSAI in Bombay High Court.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Maggi proceedings spanned the summer months and became a media spectacle of their own. At the heart of the case was whether the government order to ban the sale of Maggi was legal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-mistakes-maggi-crisis-sidebar.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1634739\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-mistakes-maggi-crisis-sidebar.png?w=780&#038;h=901\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 mistakes maggi crisis sidebar\" width=\"780\" height=\"901\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9\u2019s case was this: The FSSAI hadn\u2019t given the company a proper hearing and had failed to follow \u201cprinciples of natural justice\u201d by issuing its order. The order, Nestl\u00e9 argued, caused the company heavy financial losses and did irreparable damage to its reputation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Further, Nestl\u00e9 said, the rationale for the order was bogus, having been based on select findings of unaccredited laboratories that used improper testing methods. The FSSAI based its ban on test results for 72 samples of Maggi done by various state labs, 30 of which were found to have elevated levels of lead, though none nearly as high as the report that kicked off the crisis. But Nestl\u00e9 argued that the government had ignored overwhelming evidence\u2014the roughly 2,700 lab reports Nestl\u00e9 had submitted from internal and external labs at that point\u2014that indicated lead levels were under the permissible limit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The government case asserted that the order for the temporary ban was an urgent matter of public safety and that the regulator did give Nestl\u00e9 a hearing when Malik met with the company\u2019s officials on June 4.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Moreover, the government argued, the order caused Nestl\u00e9 no undue harm: The company had already recalled Maggi. The government\u2019s ban was temporary, covering just a 15-day period. All Nestl\u00e9 had to do was respond satisfactorily\u2014which it couldn\u2019t do because the product wasn\u2019t safe. Nestl\u00e9 had decided to incinerate the 37,000 tons of Maggi it had collected. Why would a company recall a perfectly safe product and burn it? The government order hadn\u2019t mandated that Nestl\u00e9 get rid of the noodles. (Though regulators had okayed it.) That act was tantamount to a cover-up. Likewise, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s many thousands of test results could have been easily fabricated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">The Big Question<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Was there lead in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s noodles?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The widest, most puzzling, and most important divide in the Maggi affair is over that seemingly simple question. Several state governments in India tested Maggi samples and reported elevated levels of lead. Nestl\u00e9 ran its thousands of tests and declared that no problem existed. Who was right?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Testing for lead is straightforward with sophisticated lab equipment, the findings unequivocal and reliable. Government lab analysts, though paid less than corporate colleagues, are a trained and educated group, says Ashwin Bhadri, CEO of Equinox Labs, one of India\u2019s leading private lab companies. That said, he acknowledges the labs are dreadfully underresourced and stuck with antiquated instruments. \u201cSome are 20 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the manpower or the chemicals to run the equipment. It\u2019s really sad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A week after the Maggi ban, a former director of Kolkata\u2019s Central Food Laboratory, Satya Prakash, reportedly sent a letter to the Prime Minister\u2019s office and the nation\u2019s health minister expressing concern over the nation\u2019s lack of noodle-testing standards. In 2013, Prakash, who retired in 2009, published a scathing article in which he declared \u201cthe working conditions of labs are anything but functional.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1632956-32\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"32\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In stark contrast, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Quality Assurance Center in India sits, like a glass jewel, at the center of the company\u2019s well-manicured campus in Moga. The day I visited, a scientist in a crisp white lab coat met me in the building\u2019s foyer. He greeted me warmly before turning quickly, and with discernible bitterness, to the differences between a government lab and the pristine, state-of-the-art space he was about to show me. Government labs are likely to use cheap household blenders to mix food samples, he said; Nestl\u00e9 has a $5,000 contamination-proof titanium blade. Nestl\u00e9 uses pricey porcelain bowls to hold substances, whereas the government labs probably use inexpensive ceramic ones that leach, and so on. Standing there, it was hard to imagine contamination happening in such an environment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yet Nestl\u00e9\u2019s money and its vaunted commitment to quality haven\u2019t prevented other safety-related recalls. In March the company voluntarily recalled 3 million DiGiorno, Stouffer\u2019s, and Lean Cuisine products in the U.S. \u201cbecause of the potential presence of glass pieces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Many Indians, including professionals with knowledge of the food industry, continue to suspect that there was something wrong with Maggi. They find it hard to fathom that so many government tests could be wrong, and they suggest the food giant got a little sloppy in one of its factories, where lead-contaminated water or raw material or old equipment\u2014possibly combined with the lax oversight of contract workers\u2014caused the problem.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the absence of a definitive answer, the next best thing would be a legal ruling.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Conspiracy Theories Abound<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">While the High Court of Bombay weighed the facts of the Maggi case, the affair stirred up debate around what was already a hot-button question in India: Is the presence of big foreign companies good or bad for the country?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Enter the yogi.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Suspicion of multinational companies in India is deeply rooted and very much alive\u2014perhaps most prominently in the hulking yet limber form of Baba Ramdev, a colorful yoga guru and the face of India\u2019s fastest-growing consumer goods company. Ramdev, 50, has long hair and a dark, bushy beard; he became famous in the early 2000s by leading TV yoga workouts in a saffron-colored loincloth. He parlayed his celebrity into the launch of Patanjali Ayurved, an ayurvedic medicine company, in 2006. Before long his followers were flocking to his ever-expanding line of all-natural products. (Toothpaste and ghee are his top sellers.) The goods are dirt cheap and marketed as <i>swadeshi<\/i>, or Indian. Increasingly he is taking market share from global giants like Colgate and Unilever.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ramdev is vociferously anti\u2013multinational corporations. He rails against the money they drain from the country and the ills they\u2019ve introduced to India, calling Coca-Cola and Western-style processed foods \u201cslow poison.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As Nestl\u00e9\u2019s troubles escalated, the coincidences were too good for many on social media to resist. Twitter and WhatsApp buzzed with giddy speculation that Baba Ramdev himself was behind the scandal or that he would swoop in to the rescue by launching his own Patanjali instant noodles. Finally, in mid-June, Ramdev said that after months of research\u2014wholly unrelated to Maggi\u2014Patanjali planned to launch a line of locally sourced whole-wheat noodles in late 2015.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:80%;margin-left:10%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634633\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes05_n.jpg?w=1003&#038;h=1455\" alt=\"Baba Ramdev, Maggi Noodles, Nestle\" width=\"1003\" height=\"1455\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Yoga guru and entrepreneur Baba Ramdev capitalized on the Maggi crisis to launch his own line of \u201clead and MSG-free\u201d instant noodles last November.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Jyoti Kapoor\u2014Solaris Images<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\">The guru didn\u2019t miss a chance to get in a shot at Nestl\u00e9. \u201cMaggi should apologize,\u201d said Ramdev in early June. \u201cAnd if the government takes strong measures, the company should be asked to pack up and leave the country. We don\u2019t need a company that serves poison.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On June 30 the High Court of Bombay offered Nestl\u00e9 some relief: It allowed the company to resume manufacturing Maggi for export. Singapore and Australia had already pronounced the noodles safe for sale and consumption; Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. would do so as well in the following weeks. For many it raised the question: If Maggi was fine for consumers in those developed nations, why not for the people of India?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Others reached a different conclusion. Of course the <i>exported<\/i> product was safe, I was told by some people\u2014a few of them Indian officials. Nestl\u00e9 sells a higher-quality product in other countries, these people claimed; in India, where the population and authorities have traditionally been less discerning, it pushes substandard goods. Not only was Nestl\u00e9 guilty of selling tainted noodles, these folks asserted, but it did so willfully and then engaged in a cover-up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px solid #ed1b2e;margin:0 35px 35px;line-height:1.125em;padding:1em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.125em;\">\u201cMaggi should apologize, and if the government takes strong measures, the company should be asked to pack up and leave the country. We don\u2019t need a company that serves poison.\u201d <span style=\"font-size:.875em;color:#ed1b2e;\">\u2014<em>Baba Ramdev<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s just a single strain of conspiracy theory among many. One of the most common things I was told while in India was some form of this: \u201cThere are some politics behind this case.\u201d When I\u2019d push people further on this point, accounts diverged wildly. One person might point to strained diplomatic relations between India and Switzerland over banking secrecy. Another might suggest that Nestl\u00e9 had been set up after refusing to make \u201cpolitical contributions\u201d to corrupt officials.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The possibilities are endless, and most of them have been debated in some corner of India. But Kilbinder Dosanjh, a director at risk-consulting firm Eurasia Group, says the Maggi case is less a story of unique political dynamics than a classic tale of institutional weakness in India. In that way it is the opposite of conspiracy. It\u2019s about regulatory incoherence. \u201cWhen it came to tests of these noodles, there were multiple levels of institutions dealing with this,\u201d he says. \u201cYou had state and central bodies that complicated who was responsible and what standards they were using.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Good News at Last<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">While Nestl\u00e9 waited for the high court to render its verdict, the company took steps to up its communications game. Though it stayed silent on matters before the court, the company created a Maggi information hub on its website, where visitors could view its lab reports and read up on MSG. It publicized its recall efforts. And it invited journalists to tour its Quality Assurance Center in Moga.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 India also got a boost in late July from the arrival of Suresh Narayanan as its new top executive. Narayanan, 56, had spent the previous decade covering the globe for Nestl\u00e9. In April 2015 he\u2019d been transferred to the Philippines after a lively four-year stint running Nestl\u00e9\u2019s businesses in Egypt, Libya, and Sudan. But after the Maggi situation blew up, Narayanan got a call from his boss, Wan Ling Martello, the head of Nestl\u00e9 Asia, Oceana, and Africa, asking him to move again. \u201cI need you in India,\u201d she told him.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/suresh-narayanan.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636110\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/suresh-narayanan.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Suresh Narayanan in his office at Nestle' House in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi, India. \" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Suresh Narayanan in his office at Nestle&#8217; House in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi, India.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Vivek Singh\u2014Getty Images Assignment for Fortune<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The ebullient Narayanan, an Indian himself, had begun his career with Nestl\u00e9 in the sales department in Gurgaon, and he still knew many of Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s employees and the market. He had also proved to be an expert and versatile crisis manager. In Singapore, for example, he took over just as the financial crisis hit and still managed to grow sales in a mature market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Narayanan wasted no time signaling that he would be leading Nestl\u00e9 India in a very different way. He gave an interview to the Indian press the same day he arrived. A week later he spoke for 45 minutes live on CNBC, declaring his first mission was \u201cto bring Maggi back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"border:1px solid #ed1b2e;margin:0 35px 35px;line-height:1.125em;padding:1em;font-family:'Helvetica Neue Medium', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.125em;\">\u201cWhen you manage an issue in India, you\u2019re dealing with a certain set of known entities but also a much larger set of unknown entities. It\u2019s like being shot at in the dark.\u201d <span style=\"font-size:.875em;color:#ed1b2e;\">\u2014<em>Suresh Narayanan<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">His words proved prophetic.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On Aug. 13, a couple of weeks after Narayanan\u2019s arrival, the High Court of Bombay delivered its judgment in the case. In a ruling that was unusually long\u2014145 pages\u2014the court sided with Nestl\u00e9. It overturned the ban, declaring that the FSSAI had acted arbitrarily. The judgment allowed Nestl\u00e9 India to resume sales of Maggi, on the condition that another round of samples\u201490 in all\u2014be tested for lead and cleared in the following six weeks by three labs accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 India\u2019s executives had crowded into the boardroom to watch TV coverage of the decision. Narayanan was texting updates to Martello back in Vevey until it became clear to him that it was good news. Then he sent her one more message: \u201c<small>WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON,<\/small>\u201d and added smiley emoticons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">A Nation Gets Its Noodles Back<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">The relaunch of Maggi was scheduled for Monday, Nov. 9\u2014five months and four days after the government ban, and an auspicious day in India known as Dhanteras. The first day of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, it carries associations of well-being and prosperity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Nestl\u00e9 had gotten official clearance from the Bombay High Court in October and spent weeks preparing. Nestl\u00e9 India was eager to build demand after the product\u2019s months-long absence from shelves. The company\u2019s marketers began with young people, who had proved a forgiving and fiercely loyal fan base; they had been clamoring for Maggi\u2019s return practically since the trouble began, and for them Nestl\u00e9 launched a #WeMissYouToo campaign on YouTube\u2014a series of minute-long spots starring handsome bachelors who are forlorn without their instant noodles. To court mothers, it got real moms to give video testimonials about why they still trusted Maggi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-assembly-line.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636112\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-assembly-line.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"Maggi Noodles come off the manufacturing line after the ban lifted in one of Nestle's 5 Indian factories. \" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Maggi Noodles come off the manufacturing line after the ban lifted in one of Nestle&#8217;s 5 Indian factories.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Nestle India<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For symbolic reasons Nestl\u00e9 delivered the product as widely as possible on day one. Trucks loaded with instant noodles and festooned Indian-style with colorful tassels and decals rolled out just after midnight. The no added msg label on the packages had been replaced by a new logo reading &#8220;Our commitment to goodness you can always trust.&#8221; Narayanan gave dozens of interviews repeating some version of a simple message: \u201cMaggi is safe, was safe, and always will be safe.\u201d There were Maggi-eating celebrations at Nestl\u00e9 sites across the country.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">They celebrated in Vevey too. Maggi was served at an executive board meeting. The instant-noodle dish was the second of four courses, between Terrine Saint-Hubert and fried sturgeon served with cr\u00e8me de caviar d\u2019Aquitaine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding:0;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1634742\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-noodles-divider.png?w=800&#038;h=70\" alt=\"NES.05.01.16 noodles divider\" width=\"800\" height=\"70\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family:'Helvetica Neue Bold', helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:35px;padding-left:10px;\">Taking the Long View<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\">Maggi noodles may be back on shelves, but the Maggi saga is far from over. The Monday after the big relaunch, the FSSAI filed an appeal of the Bombay court decision in India\u2019s Supreme Court. There is another legal case pending. On Aug. 12, 2015, the day before the ban was lifted, the government had sued Nestl\u00e9 India for $99 million. The complaint, lodged on behalf of consumers by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, alleged the same basic things the FSSAI\u2019s order had: that the company had sold unsafe products and misled consumers through its advertising practices. Both cases continue to work their way through the Indian courts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, Nestl\u00e9 has a wily new competitor in the noodle market. A week after the Maggi relaunch, Baba Ramdev introduced his new Patanjali noodles. They\u2019re made from atta, a \u201chealthier\u201d whole-wheat flour, and cost 10 rupees less than Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Maggi equivalent. As the robed guru whipped up a batch for media onlookers in a Delhi mall, he noted that Patanjali\u2019s product was lead- and MSG-free. Then, for the cameras, he enthusiastically slurped some down, noodles tangling in his beard.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-relaunch.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1636109\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/maggi-relaunch.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Maggie noodles return to Bhopal, India in November 2015.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Sanjeev Gupta\u2014EPA\/Corbis<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The fates of the other characters in the Maggi drama have diverged. Sanjay Singh, the inspector whose curiosity about MSG kicked off the whole crisis, received a public service award in Barabanki in January for his good work. Malik, the CEO of the FSSAI, was shifted out of his position a month after the Bombay High Court decision and transferred to India\u2019s central planning commission, where he was given a job as an \u201cadditional secretary.\u201d Meanwhile, some government officials remain incensed with Nestl\u00e9, particularly over the arrogance of its recent marketing efforts\u2014the \u201cMaggi is safe, was safe, and always will be safe\u201d language irks them. For those burnishing Brand India, the episode can\u2019t go away fast enough.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">As for Nestl\u00e9, Bulcke and his team acknowledge that they didn\u2019t play the Maggi crisis perfectly. But they defend their decision-making generally\u2014particularly the choice to privilege communication with regulators over reaction to the media. They talk about how they managed the crisis with long-term rather than short-term outcomes in mind. Nestl\u00e9 has been in India for 100 years, Bulcke stresses, and it wants to be there 100 more. You can\u2019t achieve that in a country if you blow up your relationship with the regulators.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In any case, the global giant was given an important lesson in the unpredictability of one its most promising growth markets. \u201cWhen you manage an issue in India, you\u2019re dealing with a certain set of known entities but also a much larger set of unknown entities,\u201d says Narayanan, the Nestl\u00e9 India managing director. \u201cWho is going to set off what bullet at you is what you have to keep anticipating. Where the hell is this next bullet going to come from? It\u2019s like being shot at in the dark.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The next time Nestl\u00e9 hears gunfire, maybe it will be ready to duck.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Nestl\u00e9&#8217;s Hot Mess.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"April 26, 2016","published":"2016-04-26 06:30:36","updated":"2016-04-26 06:30:36","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/nestle-maggi-noodle-crisis\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Half-Billion-Dollar Noodle Debacle in India","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/nes-05-01-16-maggi-noodles-with-headline.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2520px%2C1454px&resize=840%2C485&ssl=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photograph by The Voorhes  for Fortune Magazine; Type by Sinelab  ","caption":"","attach_id":"1634144"},"excerpt":"<p>A cautionary tale of mangled crisis management.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"462357","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/erika-fry\/","name":"Erika Fry","twitter":"ErikaFry","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/ericafry.jpg?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"WRITER HEADSHOTS \u2014 Erica Fry headshot\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/ericafry.jpg?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Erika Fry is a reporter at Fortune","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":false,"tags":false,"has_commentary_tag":false,"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"A cautionary tale of mangled crisis management.","seo":{"seo_title":"Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Half-Billion-Dollar Noodle Debacle in India","seo_description":"Nestl\u00e9 spent three decades building a beloved noodle brand in India.

If that sounds like a <i>Nova<\/i> special, it was so much more. Doctors, medical students, and the merely curious experienced the operation in real time, with 360-degree control over their vantage points, as though they were actually in the operating room.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">By now you\u2019ve probably heard the hype about the coming wave of virtual reality (VR) and the miracles that it can render in videogames, entertainment, and exploration. Interested in flying a Black Hawk helicopter over the Dubai skyline just after dawn? It can put you there. How about walking in Neil Armstrong\u2019s footsteps on the moon, or on the summit of Mount Everest? Done and done. But the live stream was a showcase of the wondrous potential of VR to educate, to train, and, more generally, to transport the masses into situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It was a mere glimpse of what Medical Realities has in mind. Imagine, for example, enabling students to actually feel the resistance when a scalpel cuts muscle. For now, workplace applications for VR tend to be rather prosaic\u2014think virtual conferencing\u2014and much of the effort to create compelling content is focused on games and entertainment. But it provides a striking vision of the potential reach and practicality of VR in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Tech powerhouses\u2014Google <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"googl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/google-40\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">googl<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Samsung, Microsoft <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"msft\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft-31\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">msft<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Sony <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"sne\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sne\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">sne<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"aapl\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple-5\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">aapl<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Intel <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"intc\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/intel-52\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">intc<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and others\u2014are creating VR hardware and software to establish a platform that they all say will rival the appeal and utility of the mobile phone or even the Internet itself. And a second, potentially much broader echelon of companies is trying to get out in front of the trend, dreaming up VR applications to change how we shop, advertise, learn, and communicate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By some estimates, the market for VR will be worth $150 billion within four years. A decade from now, who knows? It\u2019s impossible to say because no one\u2019s clear on what the platform is best suited to do. But the race is on to figure it out. Never mind that some of the largest players have tried to put things on your face before: 3-D spectacles, Google Glass, and previous incarnations of VR headsets. Those were inferior technologies, they say. This time is different. Try it for yourself and you\u2019ll understand that those technologies died so this one could live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_a1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1638138\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_a1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=725\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"725\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Programmer Tina Roh works in the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Linda A. Cicero\u2014Stanford News<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite feverish press<\/span> coverage of VR, two-thirds of the U.S. population remains unaware of the technology, according to a survey by research firm Horizon Media. That suggests a definition is in order. There are a few flavors of the technology: virtual reality, augmented reality, and a combination known as mixed reality. They all use a special headset to alter human perception and, in effect, take you somewhere or enable you to see something that would otherwise be invisible. We\u2019re lumping all the technologies under the term VR in this article, both for simplicity\u2019s sake and because all the permutations share the same roots.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Remember View-Master, the toy that debuted 77 years ago and delighted children by transporting them from their bedrooms to the Taj Mahal or the Great Smoky Mountains? Consider it an ancestor. The flight simulators of the 1980s were early incarnations. Then there were the headsets developed and abandoned by Sega and Nintendo in the \u201990s. At that point the Internet captured everybody\u2019s attention, and VR was largely forgotten. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">That all changed when Facebook <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"fb\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook-242\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">fb<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> paid $2 billion to buy the current VR poster child, Oculus, in 2014, from a 21-year-old entrepreneur named Palmer Luckey. Oculus didn\u2019t have a commercially available product at the time. But its demo was powerful enough to convince Mark Zuckerberg of VR\u2019s far-reaching utility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1636556-33\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"33\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The wisdom of his bet will be tested in the coming months. The company\u2019s first headset, Oculus Rift, priced at $599, or roughly $1,500 with a PC powerful enough to run it, began shipping in March. The Rift provides an experience unlike anything that has ever been available to consumers, thanks to remarkable advancements in screen resolution, positional tracking and movement sensors, haptic technologies (the processes that make phones and videogame controllers vibrate), computational horsepower, 3-D graphics, and audio. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Oculus executives are careful not to promise immediate mass-market success. For starters, the very mention of VR may cause ennui in some quarters and trigger memories of past promises unfulfilled. And companies will need to overcome people\u2019s aversion to wearing a snorkel-style mask. So executives have talking points to address those issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cVR has come and gone many times,\u201d says Jason Rubin, the head of content at Oculus and a legend in the gaming community. His videogames, including the <i>Crash Bandicoot<\/i> series, have sold more than 40 million copies. He\u2019s been into VR for as long as he can recall, but lately he\u2019s become fanatical. \u201cIf you go back and look at the \u201990s VR, people were basically wearing [cathode ray] TVs on their faces,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were -blurry and loud. Now we have high-resolution, low-cost screens with high refresh rates and low latency.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The constant improvement of technology has enabled the Oculus Rift to cross an indefinable but crucial threshold: It can now create situations that <i>simply feel real<\/i>. Rubin thinks gaming will be the first market, then compelling content will bring wider use. \u201cThe ramp up from launch to widespread adoption might not be as fast as it was with the smartphone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut over the long run it will be the same scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The tech giants are staking their claims. Google moved for the low end with a cardboard-and-plastic device that turns a smartphone into a VR experience. It also recently launched a VR division with far greater aspirations and invested in the startup Magic Leap, which has raised more than $1.3 billion in funding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Meanwhile, Microsoft has the HoloLens. It \u201caugments\u201d reality by layering holographic images on top of what you see of the actual world, with a headset that looks like a combination of sunglasses and a typical VR mask. The company, which is working with Autodesk <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"adsk\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/autodesk-862\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">adsk<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Japan Airlines, NASA, and Volvo, among others, intends it to enable all sorts of training and exploration scenarios. Microsoft began shipping developer kits in March but hasn\u2019t said when a consumer version will appear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Intel is putting its weight behind VR as a way to help boost PC sales. Netflix <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nflx\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix-474\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nflx<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> has a VR app. Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"amzn\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com-29\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">amzn<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> is reportedly working on one as well. And Apple is definitely up to something. The company is mum about its plans (though CEO Tim Cook has declared interest), but officials are happy to forward leaked reports about how they\u2019re hiring hundreds of people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At Nvidia <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nvda\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/nvidia-553\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nvda<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, general manager Jason Paul tells me the graphics-chip company has created a new line of chips for VR and even recently formed a new division devoted to the cause. He identifies VR as one of its three strategic growth areas, and with good reason: VR rendering requires seven times as much graphics horsepower as 1080p HD rendering. \u201cOver the last three years the technology and performance has come down to the point where it\u2019s possible to think about a mass-market audience,\u201d Paul says. \u201cVR is going to touch every industry from gaming to automotive to entertainment, and we\u2019re focused on helping build the ecosystem and deliver performance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-sidebar-vr-getting-real_v21.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637935 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-sidebar-vr-getting-real_v21.png?w=790&#038;h=1293\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.sidebar VR getting real_v2\" width=\"790\" height=\"1293\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"credit\">Illustrations by Nico 189 for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">On my recent visit, he and his team show several demos. One put me in a $180,000 Audi R8. I was able to sit in the sports car\u2019s front seat and even stick my head inside the engine. From this and the work Volvo is doing with Microsoft, it seems clear that the traditional test-drive will soon be augmented by the living room experience. You\u2019ll hear the roar of the engine and feel the vibrations of the steering wheel as you hit autobahn speeds on a twisting alpine road\u2014all from the safety of your sofa. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The arms race has already begun for selling headsets. Samsung has its Gear VR, produced with Oculus, which retails for $99 and uses a Samsung phone as the display. The company won\u2019t disclose the number of units sold since the Gear launched in November, but it\u2019s using TV ads and promotions to seed the marketplace. One recent offer: Anyone who buys a Galaxy S7 gets a free headset and six VR games. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of friction to adopting VR. If we can lower the barriers, that helps us explain why VR is so amazing, innovative, and powerful,\u201d says Nick DiCarlo, Samsung\u2019s GM of immersive products and VR. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a level of simulation quality that might\u2019ve been possible only in a $1 million system just 20 or even 10 years ago.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1636556-34\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"34\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the tech trade show CES early this year, the real excitement surrounded VR gaming. Thousands lined up outside the Oculus, HTC\u2014which launched its $799 Vive system in April\u2014and Sony PlayStation booths for the chance to spend five minutes playing VR games. PlayStation executives hope that excitement reflects how 36 million PS4 owners will react when the $399 PlayStation VR is released in October. Sony will be doing everything it can to turn gamers into proselytizers. Because as executives readily admit, the power of VR can\u2019t be conveyed through TV commercials. In the words of VP of marketing John Koller, \u201cYou just have to try it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-nick-dicarlo_v3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637926 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-nick-dicarlo_v3.png?w=790&#038;h=391\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.pullquote Nick DiCarlo_v3\" width=\"790\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"credit\">Photo: eVRydayVR<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The emergence <\/span><span class=\"s2\">of any new platform inevitably brings questions about its utility\u2014and even the businesses that first roll it out often fail to predict how it will ultimately be used.

Ma Bell was so wrapped up in the paradigm of the telegraph\u2014an expensive technology used mostly for business and life-and-death announcements\u2014that for decades it discouraged customers from using the phone for socializing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">In 1943, IBM\u2019s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ibm\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/ibm-24\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ibm<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> Thomas Watson predicted \u201ca world market for maybe five computers\u201d\u2014most likely because he was thinking about computers in terms of what they were (the size of a room) rather than what they would become (the size of a fingernail). Same with the Internet and the mobile phone. Visionaries predicted companies would one day send geotagged coupons to people\u2019s cellphones. No one saw Uber coming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Plenty of people are trying to envision compelling applications of VR. Among the more astute and sober is Jeremy Bailenson, head of Stanford University\u2019s VR lab and co-author of <i>Infinite Reality: The Hidden Blueprint of Our Virtual Lives<\/i>. He\u2019s responsible for exposing VR to captains of industry (including Zuckerberg) and heads of state (President Obama opted not to wear the headset). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Bailenson is delighted by the attention VR has been getting. It has meant large increases in funding and staff. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a real energy in the space, and we can actually produce things.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But he\u2019s quick to manage expectations. \u201cMost things don\u2019t work in VR. If you show me 20 ideas, I\u2019ll say 19 of them would be better in another medium,\u201d Bailenson says. \u201cI think VR is best for special, intense experiences\u2009&#8230;\u2009things that are expensive, dangerous, counterproductive, or impossible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-jeremy-bailenson_v3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637923 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-jeremy-bailenson_v3.png?w=790&#038;h=391\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.pullquote Jeremy Bailenson_v3\" width=\"790\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Brad Wenner<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">At his lab, I experience a series of demos that turn me\u2014a forty-something, able-bodied white guy\u2014into various form factors, including a black woman confronting an epithet-spewing racist on a city street and a disabled veteran without full use of his limbs. Clearly, Bailenson feels VR is great at fostering empathy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">He also has a capitalist streak. In January, Bailenson co-founded the VR software firm Striver, which is working with a dozen professional and college athletic teams. \u201cWith football,\u201d he says, \u201cthe teams see a huge win just getting extra repetition. You learn to recognize defenses and how to change the play at the line of scrimmage.\u201d Without, I hasten to add, fear of concussion. \u201cIn baseball, it\u2019s batters realizing what pitch is coming. It\u2019s about making decisions, experiencing something over and over, and driving that experience into your recognition.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The value of such education is hardly limited to sports. NASA uses VR to teach technicians how to repair satellites. Lowe\u2019s recently rolled out its Holoroom, which uses Oculus Rift to help customers make remodeling decisions, in seven test markets. \u201cOur first name for the Holoroom was the Marriage Savior,\u201d says Kyle Nel, executive director of Lowe\u2019s Innovation Labs. \u201cThe intent was to learn what we could do to be successful in a world where virtual and augmented reality aren\u2019t just cool but part of everyday life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_d1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1638137\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_d1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Lockheed Martin often combines virtual reality with real-world equipment when training pilots to fly fighter jets.

And the sound here is absolutely unnerving. It\u2019s crucial to get used to it, says Lockheed Martin\u2019s director of advanced technology, Atul Patel.\u201cThe worst thing that could happen on the battlefield is that you end up reacting negatively because you\u2019ve never been in that scenario.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Lockheed Martin has been using VR since the late \u201990s. It has trained more than 400,000 soldiers in the convoy training experience alone. On my visit, I \u201cfly\u201d an F-16 and take a tour to see how the company is using VR to train pilots of the world\u2019s most advanced fighter jet, the F-35 Lightning II. Sending a pilot into an actual F-35 for a warlike experience with adversaries, air threats, and partners might cost $1 million per hour or more. Do it virtually and it\u2019s a small fraction of that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s not just war games. Halfway across the country, Darin Bolthouse manages one of the world\u2019s largest VR facilities for space systems, Lockheed Martin\u2019s collaborative human immersive lab in Denver. Bolthouse and his team have incorporated VR into some 90 projects over the past year, including the next generation of GPS satellites. It helps engineers discover new approaches and answer vexing questions. \u201cI can set up a VR scenario in a matter of minutes,\u201d says Bolthouse, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re saving in the range of $10 to $15 million a year by using it. That\u2019s a conservative estimate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-kyle-nel_v3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1637924 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-16-pullquote-kyle-nel_v3.png?w=790&#038;h=391\" alt=\"VIR.05.01.16.pullquote Kyle Nel_v3\" width=\"790\" height=\"391\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"credit\">Photograph Courtesy of Lowe&#8217;s<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">What would you<\/span> <span class=\"s2\">do if you had 300 million fans in China? For the NBA, the question isn\u2019t hypothetical. The basketball league enjoys an enthusiastic Chinese following, not to mention millions of fans in other countries, the vast majority of whom will never attend an NBA game. In the U.S. it has inventory constraints. With some teams, at least, demand for seats far outstrips supply. Which leaves a lot of potential revenue on the table. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Jeff Marsilio thinks VR can help solve these problems. He\u2019s the NBA\u2019s vice president of global media distribution. Marsilio first experienced VR as a teenager in a Connecticut arcade and now declares it the future of live sports. The NBA broadcast its first live VR game last October, and Marsilio invited me to Los Angeles to witness one of its production vendors, NextVR, film a game between the L.A. Clippers and the Denver Nuggets. We join the NextVR crew at the Staples Center. It\u2019s a fairly bare-bones operation: just a few people peering into monitors and a feed from two stationary, unmanned cameras, one behind each basket. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It\u2019s clear the experience needs refining. The Gear VR uses a mobile phone as its display, the electronic equivalent of watching a game through a screen door. That said, I\u2019m transported to somewhere it would otherwise be impossible to be. It\u2019d be an exaggeration to say it feels like I\u2019m on the court, but it\u2019s far more immersive than regular TV. The camera angles switch with the game flow, so the action is always coming at me, and the NBA\u2019s grueling pace of play becomes especially pronounced.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-15-virtual-reality-nba.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1638107\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir-05-01-15-virtual-reality-nba.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=591\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Testing a virtual reality telecast for the NBA.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Andrew D.

Our fundamental strategy is to bring fans closer to the game, and VR does that in a new way. This has the potential to be the most fundamental shift in how we experience content, ever. The money will follow.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The next day, at NextVR\u2019s offices in Laguna Beach, Calif., executives show me a VR demo of sports, from mixed martial arts to baseball, and discuss a deal they signed with FoxSports. They explain that NextVR is using the same video-compression technologies they originally developed for 3-D TV in 2009. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">What makes them so sure VR won\u2019t follow the same trajectory as 3-D TV? \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison. 3-D was a TV that had depth added to it. But VR is a whole new medium,\u201d says DJ Roller, a NextVR co-founder. \u201cWith VR, you\u2019re no longer experiencing something from the outside. You\u2019re in the event. It allows fans to not just be in a front-row seat but to be in a place that you can\u2019t even buy a ticket.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_h.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1637480\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/vir05_h.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Elizabeth Baron, a Ford technical specialist uses VR to evaluate a vehicle before it is built.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Ford Motors<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">Ted Leonsis knows<\/span> a thing or two about the emergence of new media.

These days he\u2019s the CEO of Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, which owns the Washington Capitals and Washington Wizards, among other things. While reporting this story, I hear he\u2019s become a VR fanboy and that the Wizards staff is using it to train players. So I arrange a call. Leonsis gushes over VR\u2019s utility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I ask whether the goggles will impede acceptance. After all, we humans have a thing about our eyes. Some cultures abhor eye contact. In others, looking away is rude. But covering one\u2019s eyes with anything other than sunglasses just seems antisocial. I ask whether he\u2019s ever tried Google Glass.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1636556-35\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"35\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Leonsis laughs. \u201cI have them right here next to me,\u201d he says, launching into a soliloquy. \u201cI haven\u2019t worn them in two years. But that\u2019s first generation. We know optical tools and the Internet of things will become more and more mainstream. They\u2019ll get faster, cheaper, lighter, and smaller, and better apps will be developed. What will drive the social adoption? It\u2019ll be videogames\u2009\u2026\u2009two-screen environments where you\u2019re playing a game, having an experience. Say we want to go see Niagara Falls together. We\u2019re both wearing the headsets, standing out on that ledge, looking down together. It\u2019ll be personal and emotional.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I\u2019m not sure I want to go to Niagara Falls with Leonsis. But I get his point. Given a powerful enough experience, we can get over the barriers to entry (which are lowering every day). Once, you needed a desktop PC and a modem to experience the Internet. Then you got a laptop and Wi-Fi. Now you have a supercomputer in your pocket and can\u2019t imagine life without it. \u201cIt always takes longer for new technology to be socially accepted than what evangelists believe,\u201d Leonsis says. \u201cBut once it takes off, it becomes bigger than anyone imagined. VR will change every industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So think about a special experience you\u2019d love to have\u2014perhaps something expensive, dangerous, or otherwise impossible. Because there\u2019s more than $2 trillion in market capitalization betting that you\u2019ll say yes to wearing the scuba mask.

At Caf\u00e9 des Amis on Union Street in San Francisco, Parker and legendary angel investor Ron Conway\u2014both part owners of the place\u2014were sitting across from each other at a crowded banquette at what amounted to a family dinner. Ron\u2019s wife, Gayle, was next to him; Alexandra Lenas, Parker\u2019s new girlfriend and future wife, was curled up beside him. Still, the crowd was boisterous, and it was so loud that Parker had to shout to be heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI\u2019m going to cure cancer!\u201d he yelled.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The outburst was vintage Sean. \u201cWe\u2019d both had plenty of wine,\u201d remembers Conway, who has known Parker, now 36, since he was an \u201cedgy\u201d 19-year-old\u2014a daredevil hacker from Herndon, Va., whose music file-sharing company would almost single-handedly humble the recording industry. Conway, now 65, had mentored Parker through nearly every company he had helped start or lead\u2014Napster; Plaxo, an automated address book that had made clever, if infuriating, use of viral marketing; and of course Facebook, the college-dorm-project-turned-juggernaut that had made Parker truly rich. (When the company went public in May 2012, Parker\u2019s 66 million shares turned him into an instant paper billionaire. Sources close to him say that he\u2019s currently worth between $2 billion and $3 billion.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Conway had seen Parker\u2019s eyes go moonlike before; he had seen him dance from one \u201cworld-changing\u201d project to the next. But something about this declaration on this night felt different: \u201cHe looked me in the eye and said it again: \u2018I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life curing cancer. There are not going to be any more Lauras in the world.\u2019\u2009\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-36\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"36\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cLaura\u201d was Laura Ziskin, a petite, radiantly effusive woman who had produced the blockbuster Spider-Man franchise, <i>Pretty Woman,<\/i> and dozens of other movies and who had co-founded the Stand Up to Cancer movement. In the short time since Parker had met her, at a 2009 retreat on philanthropy in Tuscany, they had become exceptionally close. And when Ziskin\u2019s breast cancer had reemerged with brutal efficiency after a long remission, Parker had managed to get her into a last-ditch immunotherapy protocol at the Hutch, the famed Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle\u2014chartering private planes at his own expense to shepherd her back and forth from Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cMost of the dinner conversation at Caf\u00e9 des Amis that evening was about Laura\u2019s cancer,\u201d Conway recalls, \u201cand why they had to try everything possible to save her.\u201d Parker was deeply affected. Conway had no doubt about that. After dinner, as the party \u00adheaded for home, the valet took the older man\u2019s ticket and turned to get his car. \u201cI said, \u2018No, no, no, no!

But sub in the more Parkeresque verb \u201chack\u201d for \u201ccure,\u201d and the claim no longer seems far-fetched: Sean Parker is going to hack cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Well, yes\u2014he is.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">A hack, the way Parker defines it, is \u201ca clever work-around or a clever way of leveraging an existing system to do something you didn\u2019t think it was going to be able to do.\u201d By that definition, just about every memorable entry on Parker\u2019s steadily growing curriculum vitae, from Napster and Facebook to current projects like music-streaming company Spotify and in-home movie service The Screening Room, counts as a hack. Why wouldn\u2019t medical \u00adresearch\u2014one of the most labyrinthine, bureaucratized, and slow moving of all important human endeavors\u2014be ripe for a creative work-around of its own?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>For more on the intersection of technology and health, check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/digital-health\/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Health page<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In mid-April\u2014in an over-the-top, celebrity-gawking, Lady Gaga\u2013serenading event that brought 900 people in black tie to his 2\u00bd-acre backyard in L.A.\u2019s Holmby Hills neighborhood\u2014Parker announced a $250 million cancer research hack that he\u2019d been working on quietly, diligently, for three years: the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. PICI (pronounced \u201cpie-sea\u201d), as it\u2019s called by its member scientists, is doing something unprecedented in academic medicine: combining and coordinating the efforts of six of the top cancer immunology centers in the country\u2014MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Penn Medicine, Stanford, UCLA, and UCSF\u2014in order to greatly expand and, more important, to accelerate our understanding of why some immune-based treatments work miraculously in some patients and not at all in others. Carl June, an oncologist at Penn and a PICI team member, says he almost can\u2019t believe Parker pulled it off. \u201cNever before would I think you could get all these institutions to sign the exact same document,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><iframe id=\"fortune-iframe-embed-18c05da2184a8c3a79420e6fed359032272d511a\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" src=\"http:\/\/archive.fortune.com\/2016\/sean-parker-timeline\/index.html?iframe_id=fortune-iframe-embed-18c05da2184a8c3a79420e6fed359032272d511a\" width=\"100%\" height=\"230px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">With a critical mass of 450,000 patients annually among them, the six centers have agreed to combine their efforts on planning clinical trials in immunotherapy, recruit patients quickly, and share the information learned\u2014which could be the single biggest factor in speeding up drug development. They\u2019ll set up common platforms and standards for sharing and storing data. And perhaps most meaningful of all, PICI will manage all the intellectual property\u2014the discoveries, new drugs, new tools, new technologies\u2014that come out of the six member groups, splitting any revenue generated from this IP between the institute and the sites.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cCentrally managing the IP is an important break from the way that things are traditionally done,\u201d says Jedd Wolchok, a medical oncologist and the director of the PICI center at Memorial Sloan Kettering. \u201cBut even bigger is that the royalties and licensing go into a collective communal fund, if you will, that is redistributed to the individual scientists. So essentially, if the [Parker] experiment works, this becomes a self-perpetuating entity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It may all sound like more of a logical next step than a revolution\u2014until you come to understand, as Parker has, just how fragmented the cancer-research community has become. Lack of money isn\u2019t the main problem. There\u2019s much in what Parker calls our \u201cdysfunctional human systems\u201d that is getting in the way of anti\u00adcancer efforts throughout academia, government, and industry: the zeal for secrecy among competitors that prevents the quick sharing of ideas, tools, and platforms; the frenzy of grant applications and publication that keeps brilliant scientists from their real work; the inherent caution, baked into the regulatory system and medical culture itself, that slows the testing of promising ideas in clinical trials.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-37\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"37\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">There have to be hacks for these too, Parker thinks. By now we\u2019ve been talking in his luminous, book-strewn office in his Holmby Hills house for nearly two hours. Every few minutes he clears his throat, as though he needs to catch his breath. \u201cBetween the pure science in an academic model, in the ivory tower, so to speak, and the ultra-\u00adcutthroat laser focus of a biotech, we have to somehow bridge those two worlds in order to get [therapies] to patients\u201d faster, Parker says. In his dark sweater and pants and red beard, he looks a bit like a beat poet. But a moment later, when he\u2019s describing his own function in PICI, he\u2019s back to being a venture capitalist. His role? \u201cTo program the organization to pursue commercialization of therapies.\u201d If it works, Parker notes, PICI could be a force for cancer research for decades to come. \u201cBut that depends on us having hits,\u201d he says. \u201cI sound like a record executive now: We\u2019ve gotta have hits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For now, PICI is bringing disparate scientists to the table with funding that\u2019s gargantuan by academic-research standards. Every hospital \u201cgets a big chunk of money upfront\u2014between $20 million and $35 million, depending on the institution,\u201d says Jeff Bluestone, a UCSF scientist who\u2019s now the Parker Institute\u2019s president and CEO. Each can use it to study pretty much what\u00adever he or she wants, so long as it fits PICI\u2019s strategic road map\u2014and so long as it involves cancer immunotherapy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_m.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630953\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_m.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Tech Entrepeneur Sean Parker (left) talks to Jeff Bluestone (center), CEO and president of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, during a retreatat the Meadowood resort in St. Helena, CA.Photo by Winni Wintermeyer for Fortune.

Most immunotherapy strategies don\u2019t take aim at cancer cells directly; rather, they rev up the immune system to be more aggressive in its interdiction, or they help it zero in on malignant cells more efficiently, or they silence the \u201cstand down\u201d messages the body sends to T cells, the immune system\u2019s natural-born assassins, so that the cells can continue to seek out and kill their targets. The name given to this last strategy fits the Jason Bourne\u2013like plotline underlying the biology: \u201ccheckpoint inhibition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Immunotherapy, in short, helps the body do the dirty work of defending itself against homegrown terrorists. And the approach, say a growing number of cancer experts, is both radically intuitive and radically promising. There are more than 80 immune-related cancer therapies currently in clinical trials, fueled by many billions of dollars in pharmaceutical investment from the likes of Bristol-Myers Squibb <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"bmy\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bristol-myers-squibb-195\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">bmy<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Merck <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"mrk\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/merck-71\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">mrk<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, Pfizer <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"pfe\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/pfizer-56\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">pfe<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and dozens of biotechs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sharon Belvin is one of the miracles\u2014the kind of story that \u00adfuels the immunotherapy dream and has even long-term skeptics shaking their heads with wonder. Belvin was 22 years old in 2004 when she discovered a lump beneath her left collarbone\u2014which turned out to be an outgrowth of a tumor in her lung. The New Jersey grad student had Stage 4 melanoma, a disease for which the five-year survival rate was just 17% (meaning five out of six patients die within five years of diagnosis).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Belvin was given heavy doses of chemotherapy\u2014in 2004 that was almost all there was to offer. Her first IV infusions came in a toxic sweep on a Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. She got married that Saturday. \u201cWe had guest invites out to everybody\u2014we had been planning this for a year and a half,\u201d she says. Instead of the wedding dress she had picked out, she wore a white suit to cover the Port-a-Cath and tubes sticking out of her body. The cancer soon spread to her brain. Her chest cavity filled with 12 liters of fluid. Her body was breaking down. She couldn\u2019t breathe.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-38\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"38\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When Wolchok, Belvin\u2019s oncologist at Sloan Kettering, offered her the opportunity to participate in an immunotherapy clinical trial, she jumped at the chance. The trial involved an experimental checkpoint inhibitor from Bristol-Myers Squibb called ipilimumab (now marketed as Yervoy)\u2014whose aim was to release the molecular brakes on her own army of T cells. She got one 90-minute infusion every three to four weeks; four treatments in all. That was it. The cancer never came back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The never-coming-back part of the story is a critical element of this strategy\u2019s appeal. <span class=\"s2\">Our immune system has a great memory. In treatment of melanoma, for example, a significant percentage of patients who enter full remission with immunotherapy remain there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It is easy, of course, to get breathless about such uplifting tales. But the cancer immunotherapy saga is a long one, fraught with a century\u2019s worth of hype and disappointment. <i>Time<\/i> magazine put an immune-boosting protein called interferon on its cover in 1980; <i>Fortune<\/i> did the same in 1985 with another immune protein called interleukin-2, hailing it as a \u201cCancer Breakthrough.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t, at least for most patients in most situations.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That said, there is a growing sense among many cancer experts that immunotherapy could improve by leaps and bounds if the right mysteries are unlocked. The status quo for hundreds of thousands of people, meanwhile, is untenable: More than 333,000 Americans will be diagnosed this year in any of four cancer types in which the five-year survival rate remains lower than 20%, and in all, nearly 600,000 U.S. deaths are expected from cancer in 2016.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea-05-01-16-sean_parker_collaboration_rules.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1632483\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea-05-01-16-sean_parker_collaboration_rules.png?w=780&#038;h=375\" alt=\"HEA.05.01.16.sean_parker_collaboration_rules\" width=\"780\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the current <\/span><span class=\"s2\">phase of the war on cancer, the nation is in the midst of a hackapalooza. Or maybe \u201cspace race\u201d is more apt. President Obama\u2019s National Cancer Moonshot Initiative, announced in January\u2019s State of the Union, follows Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s Cancer MoonShot 2020, which joins MD Anderson\u2019s Moon Shots Program on an already crowded launchpad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Just two weeks or so before PICI\u2019s debut, Johns Hopkins opened its own institute for cancer immunotherapy, with a $125 million gift from donors, including billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Sidney Kimmel. That, in turn, followed ambitious cancer efforts over the years by Michael Milken and the late Andy Grove, among others (<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/22\/business-disrupting-medicine-kathy-giusti-bill-gates-michael-milken\/\" target=\"_blank\">read more here<\/a>).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">All of which raises the legitimate question of whether Parker\u2019s new endeavor is worth getting Lady Gaga over. The answer lies partly in PICI\u2019s collaboration model\u2014and partly in Parker, who has immersed himself in cancer science in the way that few of his fellow philanthropists can match, according to some of the most prominent people in the field, inside PICI and out of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cHere is a guy who\u2019s just like, wow, he gets it,\u201d says virologist Larry Corey, president and director emeritus at the Hutch. \u201cHe asks \u00adreally great questions that lead to things. And he\u2019ll stop for a minute and think. Then all of a sudden\u2014<i>bam!<\/i>\u2014out comes this great idea.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Long before his fascination with cancer, Parker was drawn to the study of the immune system by his own profoundly serious food allergies. He takes corticosteroids and carries Benadryl and an EpiPen for emergencies, but he has still ended up in the ER a number of times. Autoimmune disorders run in his family: His mom suffers from Hashimoto\u2019s disease, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">His family history is part of the connect-the-dots Parker plays without end, reading late into the night, swimming in medical papers, diving into conversations with researchers of any stripe\u2014discussing malarial vectors with Sir Richard Feachem at UCSF and checkpoint inhibitors with Jim Allison, a groundbreaking immunotherapy researcher at MD Anderson in Houston. \u201cThe first time I met him, we talked for about an hour,\u201d recalls Allison. \u201cAfter that I actually went to San Francisco and met him at a hotel, and we talked for about three hours. I was amazed. He operates at the level of a really well-trained graduate student\u2014if not better.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:70%;margin-left:15%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_l.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1631446\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_l.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=1277\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1277\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Parker in his Los Angeles home, April 7, 2016<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Joe Pugliese for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/div>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">It\u2019s a kind of seriousness belied by the lighter, harder-partying side of Parker\u2019s personality. That image was cemented in the public mind, and in a not-so-positive light, by David Fincher\u2019s movie <i>The Social Network,<\/i> in which Parker was played by Justin Timberlake as a self-serving, callous playboy. (Parker calls the depiction a \u201ccaricature,\u201d and in 24 interviews for this story, I couldn\u2019t find a single person who thinks of Parker that way or who could identify anyone who did.) Still, the Hollywood version wasn\u2019t entirely fiction. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"crm\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/salesforce-com-483\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">crm<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, remembers meeting Parker years ago\u2014\u201cin his single days,\u201d Benioff adds\u2014when Parker was being profiled by another magazine. \u201cHe had a bottle of Maker\u2019s Mark in his right hand that he proceeded to finish during the interview,\u201d Benioff recalls. But then \u201cSean would also say these amazingly prophetic and visionary, insightful, brilliant things, and he has been quite prescient in thinking about some big trends.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the cancer fight, Parker\u2019s brainpower is harnessed to a personal passion that anyone who\u2019s lost a loved one to the disease can understand\u2014the kind of passion that exerts its own gravitational pull. Even cancer doctors aren\u2019t immune. Cassian Yee, an MD Anderson oncologist, recalls meeting Parker in September 2010. The doctor, who was then at the Hutch, had flown to Los Angeles from Seattle in the afternoon, and had waited an hour for Parker in the lobby of the swank Peninsula Hotel, where the young entrepreneur had been holed up for weeks in the wake of knee surgery\u2014residing with a pair of finches that were flying about in his suite. (Someone had given them to Parker as a gift.) Then Yee and Parker, a pair of crutches by his side, took a limo to a Sony Pictures <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"sne\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/sne\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">sne<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> studio in Culver City, where a televised fundraiser, <i>Stand Up to Cancer, <\/i>was being recorded that evening.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Backstage, Parker introduced Yee to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and to Elizabeth Edwards\u2014the wife of Sen. John Edwards\u2014who had Stage 4 breast cancer and was donning a chic wig for the evening. (\u201cDo you like my new do?\u201d she asked.) Then he called over the show\u2019s producer, Laura Ziskin\u2014the friend whose breast cancer had returned with a vengeance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1631072-39\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"39\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWe want you to treat her with immunotherapy,\u201d said Parker. Yee had been practicing oncology at the Hutch with this general approach for several years. He was a believer. But there were rules\u2014the Food and Drug Administration had to sign off on each protocol, as did the Hutch\u2019s own Institutional Review Board. \u201cI can only treat melanoma patients right now,\u201d he objected. \u201cI don\u2019t have approval.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWe\u2019ll send you to an island,\u201d Parker \u00adoffered\u2014somewhere outside American jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">After a bit more prodding, Yee agreed to apply to the FDA for a single-patient, or \u201ccompassionate use,\u201d exemption to the agency\u2019s strict rules on testing investigational new drugs. (He got the approval.) Weeks later, Yee realized that he didn\u2019t have the equipment he needed to pluck out of Ziskin\u2019s blood the rare (perhaps one in 100,000) T cells that could identify the subtle peptide markers on the surface of her cancer cells and attack the disease. The doctor sent a note to Ziskin explaining the delay and apologizing. The following week, two checks from Parker, totaling $600,000, arrived at the lab. \u201cFor: laser cell sorter,\u201d the note said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Parker was resourceful, but ultimately mortality triumphed over medicine. Ziskin died in June 2011. At the next <i>Stand Up to Cancer<\/i> benefit program, Parker delivered her eulogy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">[story-section divider= &#8220;true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_e.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1630955\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/hea05_e.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Parker (center, in blue sweater) has built relationships among competing scientists at PICI retreats like this one in St. Helena, Calif.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Winni Wintermeyer for Fortune Magazine<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m trying to<\/span> fig<span class=\"s2\">ure out a way to say this,\u201d starts entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who was Facebook\u2019s first big investor, thanks largely to Parker, and who later brought on Parker at his VC firm, Founders Fund. In both technology and science, there are those who generate ideas and those who disseminate them, he explains. \u201cAnd Sean is really good at both. We tend to think of there being some sort of tradeoff,\u201d but in fact the skills are \u201cdeeply complementary.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The reason his cancer initiative has such potential when others have failed is that Parker has both the vision and the ability to articulate it, says Thiel. And there\u2019s another factor that will drive this forward, says Parker\u2019s friend Benioff, of Salesforce. It comes down to the word \u201cWhy?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cSean doesn\u2019t have a traditional motivational cause,\u201d says \u00adBenioff. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing this to be wealthy or to be known or to be significant. He is not doing this to be loved. He is doing this because he feels it. He feels it deeply inside him, and it\u2019s coming through him in the way that a tree emerges from a seed in the forest. And he can\u2019t actually stop it. It\u2019s something that has taken him over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;<del>Hacker<\/del>, <del>Bad Boy<\/del>, <del>Venture Capitalist<\/del>, <del>Disrupter<\/del>, Healer.

But a candidate who got behind a thoughtful, bipartisan policy agenda could get a lot done in the White House.<\/em><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">In just six months Amer\u00adica will elect a new President, and our nation isn\u2019t even close to having a debate that meets the gravity of this moment. Of the many serious questions going unanswered by our candidates, the most important one is, How?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>How would you, as President, bring our country together around a common vision for where we need to go and how we get there?<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Without a good answer to this question\u2014and we have yet to hear one\u2014candidates are selling little more than a fantasy, a wish list of things they would do if they were king or queen for a day. But America doesn\u2019t do monarchy, and we can\u2019t afford any more wishful thinking. What we need from our aspiring political leaders is recognition of two stark realities.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The first is that neither party is likely to have enough power to get everything it wants anytime soon. For the foreseeable future, Democrats and Republicans in Washington will have to find a way to work together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If they don\u2019t, they and the country will fail together, because the second reality is that America is running out of time. For the past few years we have benefited from an unearned dividend. Global investors poured money into our currency and companies, not because the U.S. looked so great, but because the rest of the world looked so bad. This won\u2019t last forever. America\u2019s problems\u2014\u00adranging from growing debt to incomprehensible tax and regulatory systems\u2014are deadly serious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Though America navigated the post-2008 global financial crisis era better than many nations, our stagnant employment market is a sign of our enduring problems. There are still millions of people who are out of work, working part-time when they\u2019d rather be full-time, taking low-paying jobs for which they\u2019re overqualified, or giving up looking for work altogether.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1628204-40\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"40\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the root of our problems is the refusal of our political leaders to seek common ground. Our next President\u2019s most important task is to bridge this divide, with a real plan to bring the parties and the nation together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">No Labels\u2014the growing movement of Democrats, Republicans, and independents that we lead\u2014has such a plan. On April 21 we released the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda\/\" target=\"_blank\">No Labels Policy Playbook for America\u2019s Next President<\/a>, an ambitious blueprint for bipartisan problem solving.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Over the past two years <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolabels.org\/ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\">No Labels has developed an agenda<\/a> that represents both good politics and good policy. Through nationwide polling and workshops with policy experts from across the political spectrum, we sought to identify America\u2019s most pressing challenges and develop policies that make sense, that our country can afford, and that the American people can support.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The result is a playbook of 60 concrete ideas designed to progress toward the four goals of our National Strategic Agenda. We aim to create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, secure Social Security and Medicare for the next 75 years, balance the federal budget by 2030, and make America energy-secure by 2024. The vast majority of ideas in the playbook\u2014\u00adcovering areas including taxes, the federal budget, entitlements, infrastructure, immigration, energy, regulation, and education\u2014garnered between 60% and 80% support in our polls.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/big-05-01-16-chart.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1631208\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/big-05-01-16-chart.png?w=545&#038;h=440\" alt=\"BIG.05.01.16.chart\" width=\"545\" height=\"440\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">For more, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda\/\" target=\"_blank\">fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolabels.org\/ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\">nolabels.org\/ideas<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Few of America\u2019s problems are simple, so we attacked them from multiple angles. Take, for example, America\u2019s startup crisis. Entrepreneurship is America\u2019s economic engine, with startup companies responsible for nearly all net job growth. But for the first time in modern history, more startups are dying than being born.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So we tried to figure out why. We found that small businesses are hit particularly hard by regulatory compliance, with regulations costing them over $10,000 per employee, 36% higher than the cost to larger businesses. We learned that most small businesses spend 40 hours or more annually preparing their federal taxes. And we found that access to capital remains a huge challenge, especially for minority-\u00adowned businesses, which have loan denial rates three times as high as those of non-minority-owned firms.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In our playbook, we offer real, workable solutions. We propose a sunset and reconsideration of all federal regulations after 15 years and the creation of a regulatory \u201croad map\u201d that enables entrepreneurs to view in one place all the federal, state, and local regulations that may affect their business. We recommend a radical simplification of both the corporate and individual tax codes. We also suggest reimagining the Community Reinvestment Act\u2014which provides incentives for banks to lend to people in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods\u2014to allow more funding to be funneled to startups.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Of course, just because a policy agenda polls well doesn\u2019t mean that the toughest fights\u2014about how much or whom to tax or about the proper role of government\u2014will suddenly be resolved. But our research shows that America is not as hopelessly divided as cynics and ideologues might have us believe. In fact, there are many credible ideas that address voters\u2019 most significant concerns and appeal to a broad swath of Democrats, Republicans, and independents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><div id=\"special-story-1628204-41\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"41\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The ideas in our playbook are designed to jump-start a long-overdue debate on the issues that really matter. It\u2019s on us, the American people, to demand that debate. No Labels will do its part, growing our million-plus-member citizen army and empowering a \u201cproblem-solver caucus\u201d in Congress that now numbers almost 80 members.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We have no doubt about America\u2019s ability to thrive in the 21st century. Americans are just as entrepreneurial, hardworking, and resourceful as we\u2019ve always been. We can outcompete and outwork our global competitors every day of the week.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The problem is a government that can\u2019t seem to get to yes on even the simplest issues. And make no mistake: Washington\u2019s dysfunction is directly harming the health, wealth, and well-being of American families.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It is time for America\u2019s leaders to fix, not fight.

Their crisp oxford shirts gleam in the heat as they stroll along a crumbling Havana sidewalk, the smell of gasoline mingling with ocean air. Everything surrounding Chesky, the CEO and co-founder of home-sharing startup Airbnb, and Holt, an NBC anchor, is covered in a layer of dust\u00ad\u2014the \u201957 Chevy Bel Airs, the frankensteined bicycle rickshaws, the stray dogs rolling in mud or poop. Anywhere else, a camera crew following two guys that look like they belong on a yacht might draw a crowd of onlookers. But the Cuban men and women leaning out of their windows and doors barely acknowledge the action. Down the block, someone is blasting dance music.<\/p>\n<p>Chesky alerts Holt\u2019s camera crew to the upside-down anchor symbols displayed in front of several homes. \u201cAll of these are Airbnbs,\u201d he says. Technically they are <em>casas particulares<\/em>, part of Cuba\u2019s home-rental network, which makes them <em>potential<\/em> Airbnbs. But the casas\u2019 ready-made supply, with regulations, registries, and taxes in place, made it easy for Airbnb to launch in Cuba when the U.S. loosened its travel restrictions in 2015. About 4,000 of Cuba\u2019s estimated 20,000 <em>casas particulares<\/em> have signed up with Airbnb, and 13,000 Americans have booked rooms\u2014making Cuba the fastest-growing market Airbnb has ever launched.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display:block;width:80%;margin-left:10%;margin-bottom:35px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1629223\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_b.jpg?w=970&#038;h=1455\" alt=\"The streetscape of downtown Havana (top) offers an alternative to the kind of mass tourism that Airbnb CEO co-founder Brian Chesky has criticized.\" width=\"970\" height=\"1455\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">The streetscape of downtown Havana (top) offers an alternative to the kind of mass tourism that Airbnb CEO co-founder Brian Chesky has criticized.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Lisette Poole\u2014Courtesy of Airbnb<\/span><\/div>\n<p>Of course, \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d are relative terms in Cuba. The strict Communist regime and 56 years of a U.S. trade embargo have created obstacles for Airbnb, notably that most Cubans don\u2019t have direct Internet access or a way to accept payments from an American company. (Never mind that access to running water, food, and transportation can be unreliable, especially as increased tourism from the U.S. strains the island\u2019s limited resources.)<\/p>\n<p>With 11 million people and just 3.5 million visitors a year, Cuba is a much smaller opportunity for Airbnb than, say, Brazil or Mexico. But Airbnb\u2019s promise is that you can go anywhere\u2014well, not <em>anywhere<\/em> anywhere (Crimea, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and North Korea are out), but close\u2014and feel at home. So the company has made Cuba a priority, jumping through legal and travel-visa hoops, building software work-arounds for web access, and bringing <em>casas particulares<\/em> owners into the Airbnb fold.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1627935-42\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"42\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The decision has been a public relations victory. Chesky\u2019s trip to Cuba this spring coincides with President Obama\u2019s historic visit; there, the President brags about Airbnb\u2019s $25.5 billion valuation and calls Chesky one of America\u2019s \u201coutstanding young entrepreneurs.\u201d The moment stands in contrast to Airbnb\u2019s home-turf regulatory battles: New York\u2019s attorney general has said three-quarters of its New York City listings are illegal, while San Francisco has pinched Airbnb with new taxes and pressure to shutter nonresidential listings.<\/p>\n<p>But in Cuba there are plenty of warm fuzzies to go around. Throughout the trip, Chesky describes interactions between Cuban hosts and American guests as \u201cperson-to-person diplomacy.\u201d That narrative allows Airbnb travelers to handily comply with the U.S.\u2019s \u201cpeople-to-people\u201d educational travel visa requirement.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_d.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1629225\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_d.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"Bedroom in &quot;La Rosa de Ortega&quot; listing\u2014an Airbnb listing in Havana.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/><\/a> <span class=\"caption\">Bedroom in &#8220;La Rosa de Ortega&#8221;\u2014an Airbnb listing in Havana.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Airbnb<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And Airbnb is helping Cubans become mini-entrepreneurs: The average host makes $250 per booking, a meaningful sum when the average Cuban salary is $23 a month.<\/p>\n<p>That part fits neatly into the President\u2019s promotion of the American Dream to the Cuban people. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in America, businesses that start small\u2014even in a garage\u2014can grow into some of the world\u2019s most successful companies,\u201d the President says to a beer brewery full of Cuban entrepreneurs and business people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div id=\"special-story-1627935-43\" class=\"special-story-ad special-story-ad-large\" data-pos=\"43\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><\/p>\n<p>What Chesky loves most about the country, he says, is that it\u2019s so authentic. \u201cThis is exactly what you\u2019d think it is,\u201d he marvels as he takes in Havana\u2019s paint-chipped colonial buildings. \u201cWhenever you see a picture of a place and then you actually go there, it never looks like the picture, or only one street looks like that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Authenticity is Airbnb\u2019s thing.

Almost across the board, the hosts are effusive about the transformations they\u2019re going through. At the apartment of Yuleidi and Octavio, Chesky tags a wall with Airbnb\u2019s logo, a triangular loop that the company has christened \u201cB\u00e9lo\u201d and is meant to be a sort of hobo code for \u201cuniversal belonging.\u201d (The logo caught some ridicule when it was introduced in 2014, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/artanddesign\/architecture-design-blog\/2014\/jul\/18\/balls-vagina-both-airbnb-logo-internet-parodies\" target=\"_blank\">inspiring headlines like, \u201cIs it balls, vagina or both?\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have goose bumps,\u201d Yuleidi gushes as Chesky scrawls on her wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry!\u201d Later, she uploads a photo of his message to her Airbnb listing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_c.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1629224\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_c.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/a><span class=\"caption\">Chesky (center) with a Havana host couple, in front of a wall festooned with signed notes from their Airbnb guests.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Courtesy of Airbnb<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The next host we meet actually does cry. Sitting on a bright blue velvet couch in her colonial townhouse, Reysa, a former criminal lawyer, explains that becoming an Airbnb host has allowed her to keep her home\u2014she was about to sell it\u2014and support her children. There\u2019s just one problem: She has to reject booking requests from non-Americans, since in Cuba, Airbnb is open only to Americans.<\/p>\n<p>Chesky tells Reysa, through a translator, that that rule is about to change, and the news overwhelms Reysa. <em>\u201cQu\u00e9 bien! Muy feliz!\u201d<\/em> Tears of joy stream down her face, and Airbnb\u2019s PR reps well up too. Someone hands Reysa a tissue. She says Airbnb has empowered her: It\u2019s as if a book was kept in a hidden place, and Airbnb opened it for her.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Chesky says. \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d Though what\u2019s moving us isn\u2019t what\u2019s moving him; he\u2019s got Reysa\u2019s rejected bookings on his mind. \u201cI was wondering why the conversion rate was so low,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Chesky takes notes on his phone. He later references Reysa\u2019s tears at Obama\u2019s entrepreneurship summit, at a White House press corps briefing, and in TV interviews. It can be hard to tell where the PR operation ends and Airbnb\u2019s mission begins, but on some level, it doesn\u2019t matter. The company ignites zealous enthusiasm from hosts because it has had a big impact on their lives. I wonder aloud whether Airbnb gives hosts a script for media tours like mine. Chesky says that\u2019s not possible. \u201cWhat they said is better than the script!\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Airbnb\u2019s Coup in Cuba.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"April 22, 2016","published":"2016-04-22 11:30:51","updated":"2016-04-22 11:30:51","minute":"11:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/cuba-havana-airbnb\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/cuba-havana-airbnb\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/cuba-havana-airbnb\/","outbrain_footer":false,"outbrain_right_rail":false,"short_title":"How Airbnb Pulled Off a Coup in Cuba","post_type":"page","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gri05_a.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Photo of Havana: Lisette Poole\u2014Courtesy of Airbnb","caption":"A view of Havana from one of the state-regulated rental homes in Airbnb\u2019s Cuban network","attach_id":"1629222"},"excerpt":"<p>A new tourism market has become a test case and a PR bonanza for the home-share startup.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"273114","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/erin-griffith\/","name":"Erin Griffith","twitter":"eringriffith","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Erin Griffith\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Erin Griffith is a senior writer.

But over your career you have used leverage on your buildings. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have had it both ways. I like this way better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Particularly when you were running the casino company you had a lot of debt, more than $2 billion connected to it. Is there a difference? Should someone think about running a company and leverage, and the country and leverage differently.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. They are different. But with the casino company, what many people don&#8217;t know, but what the very good businessmen do know very well, is that Atlantic City was a tremendous deal for me. I started in Atlantic City with one building and a partner. The partner was Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn put up all the money and I owned half. I then bought them out for very little and ended up own a casino for very little money.<\/p>\n<p>I then bought another casino not for $565 million as you say, but for $400 million. That was called Trump&#8217;s Castle, that later became Trump Marina. And then the third one was the Taj Majal, where I bought a company, and then sold it to Merv Griffin for a tremendous amount of money. That was a deal that was a very expensive deal for Merv Griffin and he ended up taking it into bankruptcy. But I bought the company Resorts because I wanted to get the Taj Mahal, which was half built, and I got to keep it. <span class=\"s1\">Made a lot of money on that deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"15\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4853930552001-15\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4853930552001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1SbI4hM\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Ddonaldtrump%2Cdonaldtrump2016%2Celection2016%2Cnewyorkprimary%2Ctedcruz%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Delection2016&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"s1\">You made a lot of money off of the gaming license of the Marina. You had a license and Hilton didn&#8217;t.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What happened was that Hilton was unable to get licensed because they used lawyers that were I guess inappropriate according to gaming commissions, even though those same lawyers were used by people who had licenses. I think Hilton wasn\u2019t well represented. But Hilton was not treated fairly in Atlantic City in my opinion. T<\/span><span class=\"s1\">hey were forced to sell Marina at a firesale. I got it for $400 million. I got 100% of financing by Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the head of whom was a great guy\u2014John McGillicutty. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">I said to John, give me 100% of the financing. But I also said when junk bond market comes around I&#8217;ll finance it out. I financed it out, I had no money\u2014I bought it for nothing. Same thing with the [Trump] Plaza [casino], even better than that because I was in for so little money because Holiday Inn had put up all the money, and then Holiday Inn had the big problem and I was able to buy them out for very little money. So there&#8217;s my foray into Atlantic City.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The thing I think people struggle with about your time in Atlantic City is that when your company went public in 1994\u2014 <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No, no. I hadn&#8217;t taken it public yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>You hadn&#8217;t taken it public yet?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No, I&#8217;m not public yet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I then refinanced, like you would do your house, but with junk bonds to take money out. And ultimately I took it public and took money out. <span class=\"s1\">After it was public I was not very involved. Here\u2019s the problem with AC: The politicians years ago made terrible decisions. They built a convention center in the wrong location. It was too far away from the hotels. I said, &#8216;You are making a terrible mistake.&#8217; <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Then they built the airport and they did a terrible job, and I said \u2018Folks, essentially mentally I\u2019m going to go onto other things,&#8217; and I did. I went to Manhattan projects that were very successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>But\u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let me tell you. Just so you know. Atlantic City was phenomenal for me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Right. But so\u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nobody knows it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>But let me say\u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Except for the smart people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Perhaps people struggle with your description of how you did in Atlantic City because when the finances were public, the company never made any money. And after the company went public, the stock went up a little bit to $45, but then pretty much dove straight down to zero and into the bankruptcy. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But just so you know, if you look at Atlantic City now, 75% of all the casinos in Atlantic City have gone bankrupt, or are in big trouble. And Caesars <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"czr\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/caesars-entertainment-328\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">czr<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> is bankrupt. They are all bankrupt. It&#8217;s a disaster. I got out seven years ago. My timing was incredible. I get a lot of credit for that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>But your casino company starting turning down years before the mass problems started for Atlantic City. The public numbers\u2014<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because what happened is the bond holders came to me and said why don&#8217;t you put on debt. And I said, &#8216;Let me look at it,&#8217; and they offered me so much debt, and I said, &#8216;This is too much debt for the company.&#8217; Then they wanted me to take it public. All of those things were good as an individual, but I said to them [his bankers] &#8216;Will it be a good thing or bad thing for people?&#8217; And they said to me, &#8216;Oh, no, the market is going to grow. Everything is going to grow.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Well what happens if gaming happens in Pennsylvania. You have 30% of Atlantic City&#8217;s market comes from Pennsylvania.&#8217; And they all said, &#8216;It won&#8217;t affect the Atlantic City market.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I think it will.&#8217; I was right. But by that time, I had largely left Atlantic City. I wasn&#8217;t involved very much with Atlantic City. But I called it. What killed Atlantic City, beside the bad decision making from the politicians, was gaming in Pennsylvania. And I was able to say that that was going to happen. The point is that Atlantic City for me as an individual was a very good thing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>You\u2019ve said you plan to pay off the country\u2019s debt in 10 years. How\u2019s that possible?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, I didn\u2019t say 10 years. First of all, with low interest rates, you can think in terms of refinancings, and get it down. I believe you can do certain things to pay off the debt more quickly. The most important thing is to make sure the economy stays strong. You can do it in smaller chunks. You can do it in larger chunks. And you can do it in refinancings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much of the debt could you pay off in 10 years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You could pay off a percentage of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What percentage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It depends on how aggressive you want to be. I\u2019d rather not be so aggressive. Don\u2019t forget: We have to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our military, which is being decimated by bad decisions. We have to do a lot of things. We have to reduce our debt, and the best thing we have going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren\u2019t being done, amazingly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So you like the fact that interest rates are low? Some of the candidates have said that&#8217;s wrong. Do you think interest rates should be as low as they are?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I always like low interest rates, certainly as a developer. The problem with low interest rates is it\u2019s unfair that people who\u2019ve led the American way of life\u2014the true American way of life\u2014that have saved every penny, that have paid off their mortgages, that have done everything they were supposed to do, and they were going to retire with their beautiful nest egg, and they were going to get interest on their money, and now they\u2019re getting one-eighth of 1%. I think that\u2019s unfair to those people, who have led their lives in the way they were supposed to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Should the Fed be raising interest rates? Has the Fed and Janet Yellen done a good job?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People think the Fed should be raising rates. What\u2019s a scary prospect is if you start raising rates and you have to borrow money as a country, and if the rates, instead of where they are now, the rates are substantially higher, where the rates are 3% and 4%, or whatever it may end up being. That is a very scary prospect for this country. When you start adding that kind of number to an already reasonably crippled economy, certainly in terms of what we produce, that number is a very scary number for a lot of people to be looking at. And if you notice they don&#8217;t look at it. Because they want to keep interest rates down. A frightening scenario is that interest rates go up and we have to refinance the debt at higher rates, as apposed to paying very little like we are now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think Janet Yellen is doing a good job?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think she\u2019s doing a serviceable job. But you never know if they\u2019re doing a good job until about five years after they leave office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would you reappoint her?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to comment on reappointments. I would be more inclined to put other people in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you for the audit the Fed movement, that the Congress would be able to audit the Fed&#8217;s decisions?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Totally.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A lot of business people do believe having debt is a good thing. Higher leverage leads to higher returnns. And you have talked about wiping out the debt. Why is it bad for the U.S. to have debt?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh, I would rather not have debt. But we are stuck with it. If I had a choice of taking over debt free or having $19 trillion dollars\u2014which, by the way, is going up to $21 trillion soon, because of the omnibus budget, which is a disaster\u2014I&#8217;ll take no debt every time. I can look at myself. I have lived a life where I have a lot of debt and like now I have very, very little debt and I&#8217;ll tell you it&#8217;s more pleasant with very little debt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But you may take over this country where some people think we have a lot of debt.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, where everybody thinks\u2014every sane person thinks we have a lot of debt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some people have called you a bully. Are you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think so at all, no.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But you&#8217;ve also talked about your tough negotiating skills? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t talk about them. Other people talk about them. I don&#8217;t say that I am tough. I say that I know how to negotiate. I&#8217;m a smart person. I look at the deals our country has made. This Iran deal is one of the worst negotiations I\u2019ve ever seen of any kind. Our trade deals are horrendous. Carl Icahn endorsed me. Many other people endorsed me. Great business people endorsed me. I would use our great businesspeople to negotiate those deals. Right now we have political hacks doing it. And they are negotiating the biggest deals in the world. Deals with China and Japan. And deals with Mexico. We have people who don&#8217;t have any ability, who don&#8217;t have business instinct negotiating these deals. I would use the best business minds, and we have the best in the world. I would use our best people to negotiate those deals, many of which have endorsed me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The hard business tactics, the tough negotiations, the brinksmanship in hostile M&amp;A deals for instance, that happen in business, would that work in politics. As an example, you have said that you would impose 45% tariffs on China. Is that what you really want or is that an negotiating tactic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First of all I never said that. I made a statement to the New York Times to the editorial board. And that was not said. Something different was said. I would talk to China and probably be able to get them to do what to do what they should be doing. China has zero respect for our country. They have zero respect for our president and our leadership. I would tell China that the devaluation [of the Chinese yuan] is destroying our businesses. We are losing tremendous amounts of business. Not only China. You look at what Japan is doing with the yen. You look at what others countries are doing with the devaluation and manipulation of their currencies. Something of which our leaders have no idea what&#8217;s happening. And they are systematically. I just left upstate New York, You look at Pennsylvania and Indiana where carrier just left for Mexico. I would tell China that either you start playing by the rules, or we will be imposing tariffs on your products coming in. That doesn&#8217;t mean I am doing it, because in my opinion if they believe it they are going to play by the rules. But they have to believe it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But does tough negotiations like that, where you are risking a trade war with China, does that work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What&#8217;s a trade war? How are we losing? We already have hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficit. So we have massive trade deficit with China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Similar, saying we will pull out of NATO, is that a negotiating tactic. And if so, does that work?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I never said we were going to pull out of NATO. You have 28 countries in NATO, it\u2019s 68 yrs old. It\u2019s obsolete. Right now we have to be focusing on terror. It was set up for the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s still a problem, but Russia is not the Soviet Union. NATO is obsolete and the problem is we\u2019re carrying NATO. You have many countries, known fact, that can afford to but they have decided not to pay their way. We\u2019re protecting countries within NATO and they\u2019re not paying their way. And I\u2019ve said, they have to pay their way. If they don\u2019t pay way their way, we\u2019re not going to be protecting them. They wil pay their way if said to them in the right manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s not said in a touch manner or a soft manner. It\u2019s just said. They owe us a great deal of money from delinquencies and past payments that haven\u2019t been made. In many cases, the only reason they haven\u2019t made \u2018em in many cases is they have no respect for our country. They have no respect for our leadership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But many of the NATO countries are not carrying their weight. This is a known fact. When I said NATO is obsolete and when I said the second part about not carrying their weight financially, at first there was an uproar and then if you notice a lot of people are saying, \u2018You know, Trump is right,\u2019 and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit for saying it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">There&#8217;s been reported times in your career where you have turned down deals that would take your name off buildings. The example is the Marina with the Rank Group. They wanted to make it the Hard Rock Cafe Casino, and you wanted it the Hard Rock Cafe Casino by Trump. It was reported that the negotiations broke down over the fact that you weren&#8217;t willing to take your name off the casino.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s false. <span class=\"s1\">I know nothing about the Rank Group. I don&#8217;t even know what you are talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>But you know you were in negotiations to sell Marina to the group that owned the Hard Rock Cafe.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, not really because by that time I was pretty much out\u2014<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>No, this was well before [you got out of Atlantic City], even before you changed the name to the Trump Marina. There was a deal to change then Trump&#8217;s Castle to the Hard Rock Cafe?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was a<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> long time ago, I really don\u2019t remember.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>OK. It was widely reported that you walked away from the deal. But there have been other times where negotiations have broken down because your name wouldn&#8217;t be on the project.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I would like you to name one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>That one.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You mean in all of these years, you are bringing up one deal that didn&#8217;t go anywhere, I guess, because I don&#8217;t even know about the deal. So out of all these years and all of these hundreds of buildings you bringing up one deal, and that&#8217;s the only deal you can think of.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Well that one was well reported.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I know nothing about it. The name wasn&#8217;t change. Ultimately, seven years ago, I left Atlantic City, and my timing was, as they say, incredible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So as a business man you have made the deals that were the best ones for you. As president of the United States how do you transition to putting the people of the country first and not Mr. Trump. How should people know you\u2019ll do that?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The country will always be first. I built a great company. You don&#8217;t know anything about my company. I built a company that is worth a tremendous amount of money, has a tremendous amount of cashflow\u2014its a never ending cashflow. But it is a business that is very unimportant to me if I won the presidency. My executives and my children will run the co and they\u2019ll run it well. It&#8217;s not a hard company to run. We are dealing now with over 121 deals world wide for licensing. Tell him about the hotels, Eric.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Eric Trump: <\/strong>We are opening up four this year. The remainder of the year we are opening up Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave. [in Washington, D.C.]. We are opening up the tallest building in Vancouver, which is 100% sold out, and the highest price ever seen in Vancouver. We are opening up at Turnberry in Scotland, and we are opening up in Rio right before the Olympics. We are also working on two deals that are in the hotel pipeline in Bally and Jakarta. And we&#8217;ve got a million others.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You&#8217;re so good at being a real estate developer, and running hotels, and buying properties. Why haven&#8217;t you stuck to that over your career? Why get into the airplane business, or do the steaks, or all the others stuff?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You are right. But I make a lot of money. Like the water company, I make a lot of money with the water company. But more importantly I supply water to all my facilities. Steaks and all of this. It&#8217;s just auxiliary. It&#8217;s simple, but it works well with my company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>But is it right to say that you haven&#8217;t been as good at those other things as you have been at being a real estate developer.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I do them largely for my own company, so it all fits together. Like water, it&#8217;s not a big deal for me, one way or another, but we sell it to the company. Steaks, which we do branded steaks, but it&#8217;s not a big deal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Eric Trump:<\/strong> How about the wine. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">We are now the largest winery on the East Coast of the United States. We sell 45,000 cases of wine a year. We just won double gold in San Francisco, so we beat every other Californian winery there. So there is lots we do ancillary to company and our main core which is build buildings like this that are enormously successful. [Fortune<em> note: It has been widely reported that Donald Trump no longer owns Trump Winery. It is now owned by Eric Trump.<\/em>] Look at the Apprentice. We ran one of the most longest running reality TV show in history. That&#8217;s the ancillary business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Donald Trump: <\/strong>Still running. They wanted me to do two more seasons but I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; because I am running for president.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you know what you don\u2019t do as well as other things? Do you know where you are not as strong as in other areas?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No. I think I\u2019m good in areas where I want to focus. In my life, where I want to do something I\u2019ve done it well. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">I started this company with one million loan, and the company is worth much more than $10 billion right now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">As president, do you think you will know what you don&#8217;t do as well to other things, and will get advisors, and lean on them?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Totally. I believe in getting great people and getting people who are the absolute best. As an examples for negotiating trade deals, some of the people who you interview are the right people to get. But unfortunately, we don\u2019t use in many cases those people. We use people with absolutely no ability. When China comes at us, they come with groups of 20 and everyone one of those people is trained to take every penny out of the United States that you can take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How you lined up people to be your advisors in different areas?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have a lot of people who\u2019ve supported me\u2014people like Carl Icahn and others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Anyone you can name besides Carl Icahn?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Numerous. I am going to put out a list in the next three or four weeks. We have tremendous endorsements from the business community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Have you made a decision of who you would lean on for economic policy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have made the decision but I haven&#8217;t, no\u2014there&#8217;s not one person. When it comes to economic policy I would listen to many people and ultimately make a decision. But there&#8217;s not one person.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Eventually, you will have to pick someone to be the Defense Secretary, and the Secretary of the Treasury.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sure. I\u2019m a big believer in talent and a big believer in getting the absolute best talent. We will have the best talent ever to run this country, that I can tell you. It\u2019s a very important thing. It\u2019s ultimately one of the most important thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>But you haven&#8217;t made the decision of who those people are?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have people in mind, but it\u2019s too early. First, I want to get the nom, then I want to win the election. At some point probably in between there I\u2019ll be bringing out certain names, but there is no reason to bring them out yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What current Fortune 500 CEO do you admire? <\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I don\u2019t want to say because I know so many of them, and they\u2019re friends. Some who do a great job and some who don\u2019t, frankly. But I\u2019d rather not say because I\u2019ll create such problems for myself. But I have great respect for many of them and some I like, but they don\u2019t do as good a job. If I give you a name of three, there are going to be <\/span><span class=\"s1\">30 that are not going to be exactly be happy with me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;ve got time for a few more questions. I&#8217;m enjoying it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Thanks. Switching to economics, you have won a lot of support of workers who feel like the have been left behind by politicians, globalization, and trade deals. How do you propose to bring the jobs back?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Good strong trade negotiation. I propose to bring the jobs back by not letting companies leave, and by frankly using the threat of taxation. We\u2019re talking about free markets but the problem is, we\u2019re open, but the rest of the world isn\u2019t. The only way you\u2019re going to get jobs back into this country is, No. 1, they cannot devalue their currencies, which they\u2019re killing us with. No. 2\u2014and very importantly\u2014we\u2019re going to have to use the threat of taxation in order to keep jobs here and also in order to get jobs back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have to be treated fairly by other countries. We are not being treated fairly. We are being run over by other countries, through monetary manipulation, through devaluation of their currencies, and, very importantly, through taxation. Other countries tax us and we don\u2019t tax them. I believe in free market. But we are not being treated fairly. And frankly to a large extent it&#8217;s our fault not their fault because we allow them to get away with it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>On the tariffs that you have brought up between China and Mexico. Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody&#8217;s Economy.com, has run your proposal through his model and said that it would cost us as many as 8 million jobs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s not going to cost us jobs. It&#8217;s going to bring jobs back. China charges us tariffs. We don&#8217;t charge. And anything we do is very minor by comparison.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ok. Give me one more question. Let&#8217;s go.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>If you get to the convention and you don&#8217;t have enough delegates and it looks like there are moves to deny you the nomination, how far do you plan to go. What is your strategy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have a strong strategy to get the 1,237. I think we will. We are on track to do it. A lot will depend on tonight [the New York primary]. We should have a good victory tonight, and we will see what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What happens if you get to the convention and you don&#8217;t have the delegates?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can only see what happens. Many different circumstances could cause things to go both good and bad.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You used to have a catch phrase on the show [The Apprentice], &#8220;You&#8217;re fired.&#8221; Right?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I also have a catch phrase, &#8220;Make American Great Again.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You do. But before that you were known for that other catch phrase. Have you fired anyone in this campaign?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Essentially, no. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Why not? Isn&#8217;t that part of being a good manager? Culling talent?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I started off with a small group of people. Most people said he\u2019ll never run. OK. I\u2019m now by far the leading Republican candidate. I&#8217;m leading by more than 200 delegates and more than 2 million votes. I\u2019m very happy with my people. Now we\u2019re evolving into a larger operation because it\u2019s become a very large campaign. I s<\/span><span class=\"s1\">tarted off with just a few people. Other people started off with hundreds and they\u2019re gone. You look at the kind of money that was squandered and waisted. I spent less than virtually every other candidate and I am in first place. That&#8217;s what the American people like. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s dirtier: Business or politics?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Politics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">If you get the nomination, would you self fund in the general election?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I haven\u2019t made a determination of that yet. Haven\u2019t really looked at it yet. I am totally self funding my primary campaign. I have not made that determination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You have a high unfavorable rating for a front runner. Do you have a plan to re-brand the Mr. Trump brand in the minds of voters.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m not going to rebrand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Can you make yourself likable?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In poll after poll when you look at the numbers it will show, and starting to already that I will beat Hillary. Or as I call her, \u2018Crooked Hillary. I will do very well. I\u2019ve had 55,000 negative ads against me. Other people like Kasich and Cruz have had virtually no negative ads, and despite that they can\u2019t beat me and despite that I will beat Hillary. And I will beat her very easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ok. But that&#8217;s enough questions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>You don&#8217;t have a computer in here, in your office? Do you use a computer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yes. I do. They bring one in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What kind of smartphone do you have?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Um. This. [Trump holds up a Samsung that is on his desk.] And I have both. I have an i[Phone] and I have a Samsung.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you text mostly from your phone?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sometimes from my phone. Why do you ask these questions?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Just curious. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You don&#8217;t stop. Do you?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">People have said that you have similar supporters to Bernie Sanders. You tap into the same type of frustration that people have. Do you have a plan to appeal to Bernie\u2019s supporters?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing we have in common is trade. We both know the U.S. is getting ripped off by trade. The difference is I can do something about it and he can\u2019t. Ok. Thanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Thank you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Good job, Steve.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the

full","is_magazine_content":"magazine","url":"\/2016\/04\/21\/editors-desk-no-labels-donald-trump\/","title":"Here's 60 Ways to Keep America Great","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news <\/span>about Election 2016 is that voters have sent an unambiguous message to Washing<span class=\"s2\">ton. Business as usual isn\u2019t working. Dysfunction<\/span>al politics have produced a voter insurgency that cannot be ignored.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The bad news is that most of the solutions offered by the leading candidates are half-baked, ill-conceived, and in many cases downright dangerous. Building walls, banning immigrants, blocking trade agreements, and jailing CEOs isn\u2019t the medicine the nation needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So what should a national growth agenda look like? In our current magazine issue, Jon Huntsman Jr. and Joe Lieb\u00aderman\u2014both recovering presidential aspirants themselves\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/no-labels-campaign\/\" target=\"_blank\">provide some answers<\/a>. The former Utah governor and former Connecticut senator chair an organization called No Labels that has drawn up a policy playbook of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/no-labels-policy-agenda\/\" target=\"_blank\">60 proposals<\/a> for the next President\u2019s consideration. <i>Fortune<\/i> doesn\u2019t necessarily endorse every one of them, but we think that, as a package, they deserve your serious attention.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Key to the No Labels effort is an assumption that the nation\u2019s problems are eminently solvable. The U.S. remains the shining jewel of global business. Its economy is relatively strong, its companies are the most innovative in the world, and its future is comparatively bright. Why else do the best and the brightest still come here in such numbers? What\u2019s needed is some modest attention to a few festering sores that have gone unattended. The No Labels plan addresses four of them: slow growth in jobs and living standards, a tightening financial squeeze on government retirement programs, a yawning federal budget deficit, and a nonexistent national energy policy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The proposals will leave many Washington lobbyists howling. The No Labels tax reform plan, for instance, would eliminate the lower rate for capital gains and thus provoke cries of pain from well-heeled investors. The proposal to allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices will be attacked by Big Pharma as tantamount to price controls. The proposals to cut income tax rates and sunset all regulations will anger those who think throttling business and redistributing income is the answer to inequality. In short, No Labels violates the political dogma of both the left and the right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But here\u2019s the key: Each of these 60 proposals has been poll-tested and has the support of a majority of Americans. The agenda may gore many oxen, but it is designed to be good for the herd. Whoever ends up in power after the November election should study these proposals closely. The partisan strategy for government has clearly failed. This provides the map to a new, bipartisan road forward.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Also in this issue, Shawn Tully and Roger Parloff take a serious look at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/donald-trump-businessman\/\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump\u2019s business career<\/a>, searching for clues about how he would run the nation should he prevail. Erika Fry dives deep into how Nestl\u00e9, a leading proponent of ethical business, became embroiled in a food scandal in India, and the costly lessons it learned as a result (publishing on the site soon). And Clifton Leaf explores Silicon Valley bad boy Sean Parker\u2019s $250 million plan to cure cancer (also publishing on the site soon).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;A Modest Proposal to <del>Make<\/del> Keep America Great Again.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"April 21, 2016","published":"2016-04-21 06:00:41","updated":"2016-04-21 06:00:41","minute":"6:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/editors-desk-no-labels-donald-trump\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/editors-desk-no-labels-donald-trump\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/21\/editors-desk-no-labels-donald-trump\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/edd-no-labels1.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Darren McCollester\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Former U.S. Sen.
