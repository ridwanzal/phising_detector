		<h3>Dear Pandora Visitor,</h3>

				<p>
		We are deeply, deeply sorry to say that due to licensing constraints, we can no longer allow access to Pandora for listeners located outside of the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. We will continue to work diligently to realize the vision of a truly global Pandora, but for the time being we are required to restrict its use. We are very sad to have to do this, but there is no other alternative.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We believe that you are in <b>Malaysia</b> (your IP address appears to be <b>115.132.142.240</b>).  If you believe we have made a mistake, we apologize and ask that you <a href="http://help.pandora.com/customer/portal/emails/new?t=12416&email[subject]=Restricted%20Access%20to%20Pandora">please email us</a>. 
		</p>

				<p>
		 If you have been using Pandora, we will keep a record of your existing stations and bookmarked artists and songs, so that when we are able to launch in your country, they will be waiting for you.
		</p>

		<p>
		We will be notifying listeners as licensing agreements are established in individual countries. If you would like to be notified by email when Pandora is available in your country, please enter your email address below. The pace of global licensing is hard to predict, but we have the ultimate goal of being able to offer our service everywhere.
		</p>

		<p>
		We share your disappointment and greatly appreciate your understanding.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Sincerely,
		<br><br>
