Congratulations! You've made the leap into a new, excitingly unpredictable world. And now the fun begins.\n\nIf you haven't already, you'll soon learn that there are going to be countless hard-to-navigate situations, many of which will immerse you in new levels of awkwardness. In your new role as a business leader, you'll be forced to deal with questions, issues and conflict from a completely different angle. \n\nSee also: Building a business: Why you should get married to your problem, not your solution\n\nWhile you can never be completely prepared for these strange new predicaments, you can be forewarned. \n\nHere are five awkward situations you'll have to overcome as a first-time entrepreneur:\n\n1. Being completely clueless\r\nBig surprise: You're not going to have all the answers as the head of a new company. Not only will you have to take on unfamiliar responsibilities, but you'll also have to make quick decisions with little time and information to go on. \n\nYou might feel like a deer in the headlights when everyone turns to you for an answer you don't have, but remember, just because you're not an expert in everything doesn't meant there aren't knowledgeable people around you. \n\nAs you build your team, find talent and advisors you feel comfortable turning to for advice. This means not only trusting in their expertise, but also in their values, dedication and judgment. You should always be the last one to sign off on important calls, but rely on your team and their experience to make the most informed decision possible.  \n\nBe comfortable with the idea that you don't know everything. At the same time, be confident you'll be able to figure it out. Being an entrepreneur means being a problem-solver. If your advisors and team don't quite get you to an answer, trust the gut that got you this far and go for it. You won't always be right, but at the least you'll learn something you can apply for the next round of questions.  \n\n2. Admitting you're wrong\r\nSo, you're going to make mistakes. I know I've made plenty in our journey thus far. As the company leader, those missteps can affect everyone else's hard work and create awkward situations no first-time entrepreneur wants to be in. Projects might have to be redone, timelines revisited, investors might back out, sales may be lost and product design might have to go back to the drawing board -- all because of a decision you made.\n\nWhen you realize you were wrong, own it. Don't belittle the mistake, or blame someone else.  Like Andy Dunn says, \"it's all your fault\" and there's no escaping that, so don't even try. Next, focus on what you learned and how it can be applied to the future. And then move on as quickly as possible with positivity and enthusiasm. Things have to keep moving at a startup, so there's little time to dwell on mistakes, and your team will need to see you bounce back like Rocky. \n\n3. Constantly having to raise money\r\nOne of the biggest issues new companies face is cash flow. A 2014 survey by CB Insights found that 29% of startups failed because they ran out of money, and in the current environment this number will likely increase significantly in the near future. In order to keep your new business growing rapidly, you'll have to raise capital. Then do it again. And again. (All of this assuming you're not the real unicorn that has figured out rapid growth via bootstrapping. In that case, skip to #4!)\n\nWhen my company started its first round of fundraising, I had to get comfortable quickly with asking for investment. And while we just closed a Series B fundraising round that takes our total capital raised in the history of the business to just under $20 million, it was not easy in the beginning. I pitched the wrong folks the wrong pitch at the wrong time, and that was with help from experienced VCs and entrepreneur friends helping me along the way. Raising money is hard, and it's especially hard in the early days when even you're not quite sure what you have.  \n\nThis is especially challenging if you're not naturally a salesperson. It can make you feel like you're coming off as desperate, which in all honesty, you probably will be at some point. But you can overcome that feeling. \n\nThe first trick is knowing your audience. Think about what will grab their attention and focus them on the conversation. They're hearing pitches all day, every day and you need to stand out.  Then nail down your pitch so that you can deliver it with unassailable confidence. Know your business inside and out. This includes your proof points and the numbers that back up your company's value. \n\nKeep your deck simple -- no more than 10 slides and as few words as possible: Problem, solution, market size, team, ask and an appendix with a financial forecast. That's it.\n\nAnd finally practice, practice, practice. And that doesn't just mean running your pitch by your mom. Find an independent person -- a trusted advisor, a venture capitalist that isn't a fit for some reason, or a fellow founder friend -- and ask for their feedback about what is appealing and what is falling flat.   \n\n4. Disagreements with investors\r\nOnce you get the money in the bank, it can lead to another sticky situation: deciding how to use it. And chances are, your investors aren't always going to agree with you. The 2015 State of the Startup report from Sage found that 36% of investors have relatively low trust in their entrepreneurs' financial capabilities. \n\nWhen disagreements with investors do arise, you'll need to hear them out. After all, they were the ones that gave you the money, and if they're on the board or are a trusted and experienced voice, you'll likely learn a lot. But that doesn't mean they'll always be right. \n\nYou'll have to learn to pick your battles. Should they start talking about taking the company in a direction you don't believe in, or suggesting changes that aren't aligned with the core mission, or that go against the core analytical understanding of the biz, it's time to stand your ground.\n\nIt's easy for entrepreneurs to get emotional when it comes to conflicts about the company that\u2019s become their life. But try to approach disagreements with investors as rationally as possible. Respect their input, first and foremost. Like you, they only want what's best for the business (and their dollars invested in it), and they may have insights driven by years of experience or pattern recognition across portfolio companies that can help inform the strategy. \n\nFinally, when debating a given decision, speak their language by using data and analytics to bolster your argument. You'll be more likely to get them to see things from your perspective when it comes to important financial calls if you follow these simple rules.  \n\n5. Letting someone go\r\nBeing a first-time entrepreneur means that you are now responsible and in control of your team's employment. When an employee doesn't work out or the budget dictates cuts, it's up to you to make that hard call. And with a small team and the inherent closeness that creates, letting someone go can be incredibly difficult. \n\nAbove all else, the company must come first. So if someone on the team is impeding success due to poor performance, misalignment with core values, or holding a less necessary position, you'll be the one charged with making the tough decision and delivering the news.  \n\nIn that moment, remember that every member of the team joined for one reason: to keep the company and its vision alive and thriving. Honor that, but also be as honest and sincere as possible when having the awkward \"we're letting you go\" conversation. \n\nProvide context, and always keep in mind that this is a human being with a life, and that they deserve your consideration, respect, and to be heard. But also keep it relatively short and to the point to minimize pain for everybody. It's unlikely that this task will ever become easy, but knowing it's the best decision for the company -- and often for the individual impacted -- will help keep everyone involved on the right track. \n\nIf being an entrepreneur were easy, everybody would do it -- and everybody would succeed. But as we all know, that's just not the case. Running a startup is going to drag you into a lot of uncomfortable situations you'd rather avoid. If you want your company to make it in the long-run, be ready to get out of your comfort zone. You'll come out of it on the other side a better manager, a better leader, and with a stronger company.  \n\nWhat other awkward situations will a first-time entrepreneur have to face and how can they overcome it?

There's really nothing complicated or controversial about it...I guess maybe I am looking for a similar experience today,\" Bonneau told Mashable in an email.SEE ALSO: These aerial autumn photos look like Impressionist paintingsSince January 2016, Bonneau, who also studied painting in college, has been carefully working on each work of art, just like Bob would have liked her to.\"I love his amazing expressions, sense of fashion and his sweet and curious charm...I feel like we never really get to know the real Bob Ross. Or maybe we do? It certainly seems like there is a lot more than meets the eye,\" she said.While the project started as a bit of a joke and a way to pass the time, Bonneau said, she has started to learn to \"become comfortable painting again. It's been at least 10 years since I've done any real painting. I'm starting to remember why I used to like it so much.\"What surprised her the most was how emotionally invested she became in how each work turned out when it was finished. \"It's kind of a roller coaster that way. I hope I can learn to stop taking each one so seriously. I think I'll get there,\" she said.It's important to see the forest for the happy little trees, after all. Bob would be proud.Fans of Bonneau's project can follow her journey on Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.    This gorgeous blue-gray mountain-scape includes live action snowfall!

SEE ALSO: Let's talk about THAT moment from the 'Game of Thrones' Season 6 premiereBut the revelation of Melisandre\u2019s age is more than just a visual twist of her true character, possibly offering us insight into her mindstate by the episode's end. Melisandre comes to Castle Black early in the episode to find Jon Snow dead, much to her surprise, as she had seen him fighting in the fires of her prophecies. She expected him to live and fight valiantly, not to be found as cold as the snow upon which his dead body rested.How often are Melisandre\u2019s glimpses of what\u2019s to come incorrect? By her reaction, errors would appear to be anomalies, and this anomaly has her dispirited. She not only appears advanced in age at the episode\u2019s end but dejected, downtrodden about this mistake in her fortunes.Unless, of course, there is no error. While \"The Red Woman\" does nothing to bring Jon Snow back to life, it certainly doesn\u2019t fight the notion that Jon\u2019s part to play is over, alive or dead. And whatever theory you might abide by about how he is to be resurrected, the episode opening on his body being found in the courtyard as Ghost howls into the night could certainly fuel the idea of the bastard Stark son eventually warging into his direwolf. At least he\u2019s still of some use while dead. Davos and a small group of the Night's Watch find and claim Jon\u2019s body, hoping to fight their way out with it.Ser Alliser wants Jon\u2019s body and offers Davos freedom if he and the men with him hand over Jon\u2019s body.SEE ALSO: Twitter's jokes about Melisandre on 'Game of Thrones' will never get oldWhile they seem resilient to the idea, Davos thinks he knows how to escape a grim fate for himself -- Melisandre. But is The Red Woman prepared to fight despite this misstep in her prophesying? Only time will tell, but perhaps her years (and years) of experience will hold the answers to saving Davos, his men, and, perhaps, Jon Snow.Though Castle Black is stuck in a deadlock by the end of the episode, the balance of power has changed in Dorne. Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes lead a strike on Doran Martell and his son Trystane following up on her poisoning of Myrcella last weekend. Her anger over Oberyn Martell\u2019s death and her desire for revenge has only seemingly begun, as she takes control in Dorne and likely sets her sights across the sea.Across the sea, that is, to where she has delivered a dead child to Cersei Lannister, who eagerly awaited Myrcella\u2019s return only to be met by Jaime\u2019s anguished face and her daughter\u2019s corpse. The prophecy the witch gave of her three children dying continues to come true. Rather than let prophecy rule their lives, however, Jaime wants them to take charge, and, more importantly, take back for everything in the kingdom that has been taken from them.Jaime and Cersei may look to the future with the hopes of victory, but they are not the only ones in \u201cThe Red Woman\u201d to hope for a brighter tomorrow. Sansa finds reason to regain hope via Brienne of Tarth, who knows how to make one hell of an entrance. She and Podrick arrive to defeat the Bolton guards chasing Sansa and Theon. With her life rescued, Sansa takes a mulligan, accepting Brienne\u2019s offer to guard her, which she denied during their meeting last season.\u201cThe Red Woman\u201d at large tasks the denizens of Westeros with reckoning with their fate. Do they stick to the path seemingly preordained for them, or do they take charge of their lives and decide what fate befalls them?The season premiere forces some to face a fate with no immediate signs of escape, as Daenerys learns she is to be sent to Vaes Dothrak to live out her days with other Khal widows. Arya, blind and begging for change on the streets, begins her training with The Waif, during which she\u2019s knocked down but gets up again, which she will have to do again the next day. And Tyrion and Varys find themselves in Meereen with an unknown enemy in the form of whoever leads the Sons of Harpy; this faceless foe seemingly prevents an escape by sea by burning all of the ships at port.\u201cThe Red Woman\u201d demands the characters it focuses on (and there are more still to reintroduce, as Bran is not even glimpsed in the episode) face their fates and take hold of them where they can, or at the very least learn what adversity they might face in doing so this season. Some show renewed resolve -- like Sansa -- while others show perhaps a wavering uncertainty in the power of fate, as Melisandre seemingly does.The question now is whether Melisandre sees fate's fallibility as a sign to take control of her own future or a signal that she may not be as powerful as she once thought?Have something to add to this story?

The cricketer has launched a special kit called the Virat FanBox, which gives fans access to a fan club, a new app, regular live chats, meetings and training sessions with Kohli.\n\nSee also: Indian cricketer Virat Kohli sends an important Women's Day message about harassment\n\nThe Virat FanBox includes a branded edition of the Moto G Turbo smartphone, a signed miniature cricket bat, and year-long membership of the fan club. The phone will have a special, pre-installed app that gives fans exclusive social media updates from the cricketer and monthly chats with him, along with discounts on branded merchandise and auctions. \n\nThis is a first-of-its-kind celebrity app in India. Kohli, one of India's most popular and loved cricketers at the moment, has a massive following on Twitter and Facebook already. The FanBox could let super-fans connect to the cricketer in a much more personal way -- but for a price.\n\nThe FanBox is priced at Rs 16,999 ($255), though the price of the Moto G Turbo itself is Rs 12,499 ($188). It will be available for sale from the first week of May. There may be cheaper versions of the FanBox in the next few months as well.\n\nVirat FanBox members will also get a chance to take part in campaigns and contests to meet Kohli after matches and even practice cricket with him. Kohli, in turn, will have a special button on his smartphone, to connect to his fans using the app any time.\n\nThe FanBox has been conceptualised by Singapore-based startup PrivyPlex, which plans to develop similar digital fan clubs for other Indian and international celebrities from the fieds football, basketball and Bollywood. \n\n\u201cFans demand more and more from celebrities and they deserve more as well,\u201d PrivyPlex co-founder Upmanya Misra told Mashable. \u201cThe limelight and money enjoyed by today\u2019s celebrities is unprecedented. We reach out to the celebrities to give them a platform to be closer to their fan base.\u201d Each celebrity that PrivyPlex is working with will have a customised fan box and gadget.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, celebrities waving to fans from their homes was a big deal,\u201d Misra says. \u201cToday, fans want to know their responses and views on current issues. We hope to enable these through the app.\u201d\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Once a couple matches (through a swipe function similar to Tinder's), women must message within 24 hours or lose the match. At that point, men are permitted to message back.SEE ALSO: I tried to find a new BFF on Bumble and found something betterUp until now, men had \"essentially forever\" to do so, says Wolfe.Now they're beholden to the same time window as women are.

Besides being the No. 1 most requested feature, says Wolfe, during testing in the UK over one week the male 24-hour timer increased response rate by 20%.\u00a0As for LGBTQ couples, either person may still initiate a conversation within 24 hours, but now the second person must still respond within 24 hours as well. They \"take turns,\" says Wolfe.Since its launch, women have \"made the first move\" 50 million times on Bumble. It's a proud figure for the company, which combats the stereotype of a \"desperate\" woman as the one who initiates the conversation. \u00a0\"It shouldn't be game changing,\" says Wolfe. Women should be able to function equally in the dating world.\u00a0Until then, everyone has 24 hours to reply.The app is available for free on iOS and Android.Have something to add to this story?

The deep, red-orange body of the hot sauce looks almost like Frank\u2019s Red Hot, but menacing flecks of red, brown and yellow set it apart from your run-of-the-mill, diner table Cholula or Tabasco.Black-gloved hands stick a baster into the glass bottle of the 10^32 Kelvin hot sauce and suck up a bit of it, releasing a few drops onto a little cardboard tasting boat. Within those spicy drops swims habanero pepper, ghost pepper and the two hottest chili peppers in the world -- the Trinidad moruga scorpion and the Carolina Reaper.SEE ALSO: The donut ice cream cone has arrived to make your dessert dreams come trueTo avoid looking like amateur, I plunge the whole thing into my mouth, getting it on my lips, tongue and gums. For a moment, the concoction of hellish peppers and unknown ingredients creates a delicious, smoky, savory flavor I could imagine slathering over ribs. After a couple seconds, the pain starts building. Quickly.The science of hot sauce10^32 Kelvin is GE\u2019s hot sauce tribute to \u201cabsolute hot,\u201d the temperature at which scientists theorize all matter starts to break down. It was created in partnership with Steve Seabury of High River Sauces and Thrillist. The hot sauce is also a shout out to some of the work that GE does with creating engine parts. When manufacturing industrial jet engines, locomotives and turbines, GE needs to create parts that are both light and super strong, withstanding temperatures above 3,000 degrees.At SXSW in 2015, GE had a similar food-science project to show off -- a high-tech BBQ smoker that gives you more BBQ data than most people know what to do with.To herald 10^32 Kelvin\u2019s release, GE brought the science of hot sauce to Heatonist, a hot sauce store situated in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The entrance features shelves of different flavors; bright yellow bottles of pineapple habanero, pale-brown bottles containing manzana peppers, absurdly red bottles touting the infamous ghost pepper. Beyond them and behind a sliding wooden door, mouth-cooling treats, hot sauce-infused ice cream and people in lab coats mingle around the star of the evening.The science of hot sauce lies primarily in capsaicin, the compound found in chili peppers that gives them heat. This heat is measured with the Scoville scale, a relatively subjective spiciness scale that gives a good idea of how spicy different peppers are.For example, the jalape\u00f1o pepper averages around 5,000 Scoville heat units -- a decent kick. Orange habanero peppers are about 70 times hotter, measuring between 150,000-350,000 SHU. That\u2019s a big jump.SEE ALSO: 20 American craft breweries for an ultimate beer road tripThe hotter peppers look absurd compared to the habanero, because they are absurdThose peppers look like a joke compared to the so-called \"ghost pepper\" (formally called the bhut jolokia), which can reach over 1 million SHU. And the Trinidad moruga scorpion ranges from nearly 600,000 to 2 million SHU. The hottest known pepper in the world, the Carolina Reaper, hits between 1.4 and 2.2 million SHU. That\u2019s about 440 times hotter than a jalape\u00f1o.Individual peppers and bottles of hot sauce can range in heat quite a bit, because capsaicin amounts aren\u2019t identical in each kind of pepper, just like how some strawberries taste sweeter than others.Setting my mouth on fireWhether the capsaicin amount curves high or low in this three-drop sample of 10^32 Kelvin, I know it\u2019s going to hurt. And it does.After about two seconds of admiring its flavor, the sauce starts making my mouth tingle as a sharp pain spreads across the lower half of my face. It\u2019s bearable for maybe 30 seconds, and then my eyes start to water and I can feel sweat start sprouting from my hairline.The pain keeps mounting, not unlike the feeling about 15 minutes after you finish getting a tattooThe pain keeps mounting, not unlike the feeling about 15 minutes after you finish getting a tattoo and your body decides to ask why you just let someone scrape a vibrating needle across your skin for so long. But worse. Much worse.The habanero and Carolina Reaper provide the brunt of the heat up front, but the ghost pepper and Trinidad moruga scorpion make it last for an unbearable 15 minutes or so. The only liquids in sight to wash the spice away are water and white wine, so I grabbed the white wine.The sweltering heat lasts for about 20 minutes, then the endorphins start to fill my brain with happy feelings. I feel a little dizzy, but that could be the wine I sucked down.What capsaicin does to your bodyWhen you ingest capsaicin, your body isn\u2019t really a big fan of it. GE brought a thermal imaging machine to Heatonist that showed you what happens to your face when it meets the heat of 10^32 Kelvin.Normally, your whole face would read as pretty much the same temperature, but after eating a little hot sauce, you can see that my nose and mouth look blue -- there\u2019s been a temperature decrease.That\u2019s because your body recognizes the awful things you\u2019ve just put into your mouth and is preparing your stomach to handle it. Your blood moves from your mouth and nose down to your digestive system so your body can focus on getting through the next phase of eating spicy peppers.When you eat a ton of capsaicin, like an entire Carolina Reaper, the outer layer of your mouth can blister and your throat can swell. And of course, your digestive system panics and tries to push everything through as fast as it can -- not a fun experience.Measuring heatBecause capsaicin isn\u2019t something you can really physically pick out of a hot sauce sample, GE used a scientific method to determine how much capsaicin is in 10^32 Kelvin compared to other hot sauces.With the guidance of GE research scientist John Nelson, I extracted capsaicin from the hot sauce by putting some in oil, thoroughly mixing it with a vibrating machine. Because the capsaicin is oil-soluble, it leaves the hot sauce and attaches to oil molecules.SEE ALSO: Literally 'Feel the Bern' with Bernie Sanders hot sauceTo separate the oil and the hot sauce, you take the mixture for a spin in a centrifuge, creating a layer of hot sauce and a layer of oil and capsaicin. I then extracted the oil and capsaicin and placed a drop of it into a spectrophotometer. Spectrophotometers send light waves through substances and measure how much light they absorb. Because capsaicin absorbs ultraviolet light, you can determine how much capsaicin is in a sample by how much ultraviolet light passes through it.Compared to more common hot sauces, 10^32 Kelvin obviously has a lot more capsaicin in it. GE made a graph of popular hot sauces and how they fared in the spectrophotometer. You can see in the ultraviolet wavelength of 280nm that 10^32 Kelvin beats out every sauce by a large margin.Availability10^32 Kelvin is now available to buy online for $20. To make sure it doesn\u2019t do any damage (well, inadvertent damage), it comes packaged in \"supermaterials\" that GE uses in high-temperature industrial engines used in jets and turbines.Even for hot sauce pros, more than a couple drops of 10^32 Kelvin can make you sweat.

OK, maybe not turned upside down, but there\u2019s a whole lot more to the platform than uploading your resume and forgetting about it.SEE ALSO: 23 free LinkedIn backgrounds that will make recruiters love your profileSeriously, whether you\u2019re a C-level executive, an entry-level wannabe, or, like most of us, somewhere in between, using LinkedIn to its full potential can help you become more successful in your career.Want proof?Professionals who have an All-Star rating \u201care 40 times more likely to receive opportunities through LinkedIn.\u201dHow do you get that rating?As a LinkedIn insider, let me tell you: it takes seven essential elements to have a completed profile. To qualify, your page must contain the following:Industry and locationAn up-to-date current position (with a description)Two past positionsEducationSkills (minimum of three)Profile photoAt least 50 connectionsFilling in these fields is only the first step, but it\u2019s a good one because only 51 percent\u00a0of members have a completed profile. Once you cut out half the competition, your next move is to separate yourself from within the All-Star pack.Here are 10 steps to improving your LinkedIn profile from top to bottom.Step 1: Add (the right) photosAdding a professional photo makes you 11 times more likely to be found by hiring managers and recruiters. This is important because more profile views can translate to more visibility in your industry and more connections.Don\u2019t forget the basics: only you should be in your picture! As for what to wear, my rule of thumb is to look at the dress code in your industry and dress slightly more formal. And before you worry that you can\u2019t afford to hire a professional, don\u2019t \u2014 here\u2019s how to fake a professional headshot for free.In addition to your profile picture, add a background image. It\u2019s a nice touch to improve your look, and it can help you weave a consistent story.Step 2: Write a better headlineThe next step is to write an attention-grabbing headline. Quickly explain what you currently do as well as what you want to be doing (if it\u2019s not the same). Show your passion and how you add value.So, instead of defaulting to a job title, add a bit more, like this:Experienced Writer Creating Content for Fortune 500 CompaniesSocial Media Expert Seeking Nonprofit OpportunitiesUse keywords (not overused buzzwords) that make it easy for others to find you. You can identify the right options by reviewing job descriptions in your industry.Step 3: Claim your URLJust below the photo and headline is your profile\u2019s URL. You can customize it by hovering over the Profile menu and selecting Edit Profile. From there, hover over the URL, then click on the gear image. You can then make the edit in the top right corner of the page. A customized URL will increase your search results, make it easier to direct people to your profile (especially a bonus if you have a common name), and it\u2019ll look sharp in email signatures and on business cards.SEE ALSO: How to make your LinkedIn headline way more effective in under 5 minutesStep 4: Revise your summaryMany people neglect writing a summary, likely because it takes time and energy to craft a compelling one. But this section doesn\u2019t need to be long. In fact, just a few short paragraphs summarizing your professional background, areas of expertise and key accomplishments will do the trick. Does your past experience differ from where you want to go? If so, your summary is the perfect opportunity to connect the dots.Step 5: Showcase your experienceFar too many professionals simply paste resume bullet points from each of their positions. But your experience section can be so much more. Think about what you\u2019ve achieved, delivered and learned in each of your positions. Include distinct measurables and quantify whenever possible. Share details of interesting projects and key accomplishments.And don\u2019t forget to illustrate your unique professional story and achievements by adding visuals. Including pictures, compelling videos, links to news stories, press releases and innovative presentations you\u2019ve delivered will bring your experiences to life.Step 6: Don\u2019t neglect your educationThe education section is especially important for students and recent graduates, because fellow students and alumni are a key part of your network, and if someone searches for \u201cpeople who studied at [your University]\u201d (which is a LinkedIn search prompt), you want to show up in the results. Especially if your experience section is otherwise a bit thin, you can include relevant coursework, school projects, case competitions and extracurricular activities. Like your experience section, you can set yourself apart by adding rich media.SEE ALSO: 8 LinkedIn secrets you haven\u2019t heard beforeStep 7: Add volunteer experience and causesAdding volunteer work and causes you care about will round out your professional identity. Did you know that almost half of all hiring managers view volunteer experience as \u201cequivalent to full-time work experience?\u201dStep 8: Take skills and endorsements seriouslyMembers who list skills on their LinkedIn profile receive an average of 13 times more profile views. Just make sure you\u2019re sharing the right skills: one way to identify relevant skills is to review profiles of your peers and colleagues \u2014 and add the ones that apply to you, too.A lot of people role their eyes at the endorsement feature because they\u2019ve seen some\u00a0pretty silly ones. But not taking this feature seriously is a missed opportunity. However, there\u2019s evidence that more endorsements will lead to higher LinkedIn search results. And did you know that you can edit the order of your skills and put the most important ones at the top? Doing so will increase the likelihood you get endorsed for the ones you care most about.Step 9: Ask for recommendationsWhile it may not affect the search metric, recommendations feel more reliable than skill endorsements, so you want to be sure you have those, too. Many professionals get endorsed for skills by people who hardly know them, but this isn\u2019t the case with a recommendation. Having these is a powerful way to show your value to the world. Aim to have one to two for each position. Consider asking peers, clients, and managers shortly after you receive feedback so you can build them up slowly, rather than feeling pressured to get a bunch at once.SEE ALSO: 9 tiny tweaks that\u2019ll make your LinkedIn profile top-notchStep 10: Round it outFinally, here are a few profile sections that often get overlooked. While not the core of your profile, completing these elements can strengthen your presence:Companies Followed: I\u2019ve heard career advisors share that some companies actively monitor their followers and will proactively reach out to people who are a good fit.Groups: engaging within groups is a great way to meet new people, but it\u2019s also a way to signal your interests and share your expertise.Awards and Certificates: if you\u2019ve been given a relevant award or have an industry certification, don\u2019t be bashful about sharing it on your profile!Personal Interests: while perhaps not appropriate for every industry, often adding a few hobbies or interests can humanize your profile and bring a personal touch.Above all else, remember that your profile should tell the story of where you\u2019ve been, where you are now and where you want to be in the future. It\u2019s a living document that should be updated and refined on a regular basis. So, set aside time to review what you currently have and make the needed changes. LinkedIn can connect you with opportunity, but only if you\u2019re prepared."},"shares":{"linked_in":278,"twitter":776,"facebook":77,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"comments_count":0,"image":"/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzIzLzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLmFiNmQ0LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/9a1d5aab/87c/Not_Cropped.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/95578a0e/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTYzOHgzNjgjCmUJanBn/d2001229/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyNzZ4NzM2IwplCWpwZw/1c676cf7/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/42063e8d/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/88d52e0d/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/6aa977ca/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA0LzI0Lzc3L05vdF9Dcm9wcGVkLjIwNTQyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/8d01673f/009/Not_Cropped.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1MRosj3","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"10 tips that will help you score an 'All-Star' rating on LinkedIn","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Whether you\u2019re a C-level executive, an entry-level wannabe, or, like most of us, somewhere in between, using LinkedIn to its full potential can help you become more successful in your career.","show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"10 tips that will help you score an 'All-Star' rating on LinkedIn"},{"_id":"571d72dcb05f9d5cdf001127","id":"2016/04/24/obama-jk-rowling-dinner","title":"J.K.

One of the men then started to stomp on all the buns while hurling verbal abuse at a woman, while his accomplice stood by and watched.SEE ALSO: Restaurateur beaten to death by alleged Chinese government officials dining freePictures showed the woman, who has since been identified as the stall owner, squatting next to the scene, trying to clean up the mess.As soon as the pics went viral, Chinese netizens called upon local authorities to arrest the two tyrants and punish them.According to Beijing Youth Daily, the stall's owner who goes by the surname Wang, clarified that the incident occurred not due to the men being served the wrong buns, but instead was due to a drunken altercation between a man and his friends.\"When I watched the news this morning, my first reaction was to cry,\" she said. \"I feel particularly aggrieved that it happened not because of buns with the wrong stuffing. I've been in this business for many years, I've never come across such a reason to smash things.\"The Beijing Chaoyang police has since verified the cause of the incident. It's unclear if authorities will press charges on the men.Currently, a settlement between the offenders and stall owners is being negotiated.Have something to add to this story?

End of story. (Note: We also know that the stench of a sea salt-seasoned walker is 100 times stronger than his loyalty toward those on the boat will ever be.)\u00a0But after the other tried once again to pick up a couple of stragglers, Strand drew a line in the sand -- with a big cleaver.Let me back up.\u00a0Hey, that looks safe\u00a0After learning how dangerous it is to get off their boat in last week's episode, the gang had a brilliant idea this week: Let's get off the boat.\u00a0Alicia was the one who prompted the field trip to a little island that seemed to be littered with various pieces of abandoned luggage from a crashed plane. (Yes, this is where the Flight 462 tie-in comes in.) The kids -- technically they're young adults, but no one's acting like it -- were firmly in favor of this excursion and, unsurprisingly, Madison was against it. But with their boat stalled by a walker stuck in their motor or filter or something -- sorry, I don't speak Boat -- they didn't really have anything better to do. Plus, they needed supplies.\u00a0Daniel was particularly motivated to play chaperon because Ophelia's injury had become infected and the medicine on board wasn't doing the trick. He only shared this info with Nick, who was more than happy to share with Daniel his pharmaceutical knowledge to help him find the right meds.\u00a0It was refreshing to see Daniel play one hand not so close to the chest; it shows he respects Nick. That bond is really fun to watch develop, particularly because both actors have a great, dueling chemistry. Daniel is intense and Nick can be a lovable idiot at times.\u00a0Nick, though, seems to only have two sides these days -- lighthearted former addict and reckless survivor. This week, he seemed to learn that little trick we all know from The Walking Dead about dressing up in zombie guts as a defense mechanism. That Nick, he's the sharpest tool this group has.\u00a0Chris wants to be a sharp tool, but succeeds in only being a tool. In this episode, after being told specifically to stay together, he ventured off and ended up encountering some trouble while snooping around the plane wreckage. That trouble came in the form of a few zombies and a man who was very much alive but still trapped inside his seat. For a second, Chris thought he could save the man, but after getting an eye full of the man's exposed spine, he was hit with the realization that this man was not getting off the island. So he bashed his head in -- as a favor.\u00a0He played it cool when he finally met up with the group, but I doubt this won't entirely screw him up mentally. Unlike Nick, Chris didn't really know mental anguish before this -- well, at least as far as we know. He's not ready for it and it's written all over his face. I swear the kid is developing a bad case of crazy eyes.Once the gang escaped a wave of plane crash zombies, they ended up back on the boat with two extra bodies -- Jake and Alex (wasn't it Charlie?!) from 462.\u00a0Half of Jake's face had been burned badly and the kid is struggling to breathe, but Alex was determined to help him.\u00a0Madison tried to reason with Strand, who refused to let them on board. He ended up agreeing to tow them in their raft, much to the chagrin of everyone else. So they armed Alex and Jake with water, blankets and food, and watched regrettably as they got dragged along.\u00a0It lasted for a bit, until Strand walked down from his post and cut the rope that was attached to the raft with a knife.\u00a0So much for progress.\u00a0Tasty Morsels:\u00a0Madison confronted Strand about Baja on Daniel's prompting. He revealed he has a house there and plans on taking the group there. Madison was unsure how to feel about the sudden reveal -- after all, he could have said something before. But she ultimately decided to trust him. TBD how that will work out.\u00a0\"Should I get you some flippers?\" -- Madison, with the line of the night.

The white supremacy symbols and literature that have been associated with the alleged shooter, Dylann Roof, caused a ripple effect that has prompted a\u00a0reconsideration of some objects named for Confederate leaders.\u00a0Many cities, including Austin, have removed statues of Confederate leaders from public view or renamed streets and buildings named after Confederate figures.Ultimately, Austin school officials will get the final say in what they name the school, but they opened up the process to suggestions from the public and the public responded with some creative, unique suggestions.\u00a0What else would you expect from a city that has \"weird\" right in its motto?Among the top vote-getters: Donald J.
