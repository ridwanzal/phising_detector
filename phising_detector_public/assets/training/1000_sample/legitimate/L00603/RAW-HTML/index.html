      <p><img alt="0422-prince-getty-01" src="http://ll-media.tmz.com/2016/04/22/0422-prince-getty-10.jpg" />It appears <a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/prince/" target="_blank"><strong>Prince</strong></a> died without leaving a will ... as a result his 6 siblings -- even the half brothers and sisters -- could split a fortune.</p>
<p>Multiple sources who have worked with Prince as recently as 2014 tell us ... he did not have a will. Of course it's possible in the last year or so Prince had a change of heart and drafted one, but all of our sources say based on his history with them that's highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Our sources say various professionals raised the issue of a will with Prince but he never had an interest in drafting one.</p>
<p>We've contacted various people, including family members, and they all say they have not seen a will and so far no one has come forward with one.</p>
<p>If Prince did indeed die without a will, under Minnesota law his siblings -- the closest living relatives -- would share equally in his estate. Prince had 8 brothers and sisters, and only <strong>Tyka</strong> was a full sibling. &#160;</p>
<p>People have assumed Tyka -- who has taken the reins -- would get everything, but that's not the case. In Minnesota half siblings and full siblings are treated exactly the same when it comes to inheritance without a will ... they all share equally.</p>
<p>Two of Prince's siblings are dead, leaving 6. There's one catch. If the deceased siblings had kids, they would be entitled to the same share as their parent.</p>
<p>As we reported ... our sources say Prince's estate is worth somewhere south of $150 million.</p>

<p>We spoke with <strong>Anthony Anzaldo</strong> ... who tells us Chyna's closest friends had become concerned about her prescription drug use in recent weeks -- worried that she was over-medicating herself with Ambien and Valium. He's adamant Chyna's issue was ONLY with Rx meds. &#160;</p>
<p>Anzaldo says he entered into talks with "Intervention" producers about doing an episode with Chyna -- in the hopes they could get her back on the right path before it was too late.&#160;</p>
<p>We're told an agreement was reached -- and the plan was to get a bunch of Chyna's closest WWE friends, including <strong>Stone Cold Steve Austin</strong> and<strong> Mick Foley</strong>, to participate in the intervention.&#160;</p>
<p>"An interventionalist was already lined up as was a facility that was going to take her for 90 days," Anzaldo says. We reached out to "Intervention" -- so far, no word back.&#160;</p>
<p>Anzaldo says he became concerned when he hadn't heard from Chyna in days and went to her Redondo Beach apartment to check in on Wednesday evening.&#160;</p>
<p>"I found her," Anzaldo says ... noting that he believes <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/04/20/chyna-dead-wwe-legend-dies/" target="_blank"><strong>she died in her sleep</strong></a>. "She looked f**king peaceful."</p>
<p>As for the future, Anzaldo says he's planning a huge memorial for Chyna -- with celebs and fans ... hoping to give Chyna the send-off she deserved.&#160;</p>

      <p><img alt="0422_prince_getty_2" src="http://ll-media.tmz.com/2016/04/22/0422-prince-getty-7.jpg" /><a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/prince/" target="_blank"><strong>Prince</strong></a> had chronic money problems for years preceding his death ... this according to multiple sources who advised the singer.</p>
<p>Our sources -- all of whom had regular contact with Prince and were intimately familiar with his finances -- tell us, the singer refused to leverage or sell his main asset -- his vast music catalog.</p>
<p>The most common way singers like Prince make a steady flow of income is to sell or license their art. We're told Prince consistently shut down business opportunities that could have fueled his finances. Prince had numerous opportunities to use his music in movies, TV shows and commercials, but with few exceptions, he turned thumbs down.</p>
<p>The primary way Prince made money was concerts, but our sources say the singer was so impulsive he would do shows on the spur of the moment with poor planning and little promotion. Although many were successful, enough of them weren't ... causing him to lose a fortune.</p>
<p>The biggest problem ... Prince spent way more than he made, and our sources say money was always an issue. As we reported, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/04/24/prince-death-money-business-advisers/" target="_blank"><strong>the estimated net worth of $300 million</strong></a> was grossly inflated. We're told it's less than half that. It's still a lot of money, but it could've been so much more if he'd cashed in on his greatest asset ... that catalog.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/michael-strahan/" target="_blank"><strong>Michael Strahan</strong></a> just made the biggest mistake of his career by choosing 'GMA' over "<strong>Live! with Kelly and Michael</strong>" ... at least according to <a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/andy-cohen/" target="_blank"><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Andy took a stand for his BFF, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/kelly-ripa/" target="_blank"><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a>, during his SiriusXM show Monday morning ... calling out Strahan for taking the 'GMA' gig. The way Andy sees it, it's a numbers game and Strahan's taking a big risk leaving his established spot on 'Live.'</p>
<p>He said, "What happens if the ['GMA'] ratings don't go up? What is going to happen to this sweet man? By then she will have a new co-host."</p>
<p>Andy's already said he doesn't have time to take the job with Kelly -- if it were offered to him -- but he does have another good friend in mind for the job.</p>

<p>So now, with an appeals court ruling that <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/04/25/tom-brady-must-serve-deflategate-suspension-appeals-court-rules/" target="_blank"><strong>Brady must serve the penalty</strong></a> -- Trump began his rally this morning with another staunch defense of the Patriots QB.&#160;</p>
<p>The brofest isn't one-sided ... remember, Brady had Trump's <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2015/09/07/tom-brady-locker-donald-trump-hat-make-america-great-again/" target="_blank"><strong>campaign hat proudly displayed in his locker</strong></a> ... though he has not given Trump his official endorsement.</p>
<p>... yet.&#160;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/prince/" target="_blank"><strong>Prince</strong></a>'s former band members,&#160;<a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/wendy-melvoin/" target="_blank"><strong>Wendy Melvoin</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/lisa-coleman/" target="_blank"><strong>Lisa Coleman</strong></a>, are speaking out for the first time about his death.</p>
<p>Wendy (guitar) and Lisa (keyboards) -- the most prominent members of <strong>The Revolution</strong> -- were at LAX Sunday morning, on their way to Minnesota ... and revealed plans for the band to get back together to honor their friend and bandleader.</p>
<p>If, like most people, you watched "<strong>Purple Rain</strong>" this weekend ... you saw how close Prince was to Wendy and Lisa, and it's clear in this video just how crushed they are by the loss.</p>
<p>Prince split from The Revolution in 1986, but still occasionally performed with Wendy and Lisa. One of the last times was an instant classic gig at the 2006 Brit Awards.</p>

<p>These photos were taken inside <strong>Paisley Park</strong>&#160;and reveal some of what fans could be seeing in the near future. <strong>Sheila E.</strong> has said plans are in the works to turn PP into a museum.</p>
<p>Check out the gallery -- Prince's awards, photos, costumes (yeah, the "Raspberry Beret" one), and even his famous motorcycle ... it's all there.</p>
<p>Think Graceland. But cooler. And more purple.</p>

<p>Prince's nephew, Pres Nelson, did the honors as his mom, Prince's sister Tyka, cleared the way. We don't know the identity of the woman walking behind Pres.</p>
<p>Pres shielded the urn by placing it underneath his jacket.</p>
<p>So far, the family hasn't said where the ashes will be strewn.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/the-game/" target="_blank"><strong>The Game</strong></a> came thiis close to cutting a hit song with <a href="http://www.tmz.com/person/prince/" target="_blank"><strong>Prince</strong></a>, but ultimately ... a curse killed the project.</p>
<p>Game was in Bev Hills -- shopping for a Prince party, btw -- when he revealed his Prince experience ... meeting up to discuss a collabo a few years ago.</p>
<p>You gotta see Game explain how his commitment to cussing ended up sinking the deal. Yes, he actually chose the four-letter word over getting Prince on the track.</p>
<p>No hard feelings though. As Game puts it, "That's the evolution of people in their lives."</p>
